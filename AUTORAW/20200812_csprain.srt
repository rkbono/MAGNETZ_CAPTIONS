1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,319
so um thank you everyone for uh joining

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,040
us for our next

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,160
uh magnets talk um which is going to be

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,400
given today by

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,840
courtney sprain um and before we begin

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,599
i just want to remind people that we'll

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,880
be talking for about

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
20 to 25 minutes so please keep your

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
microphones

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,560
muted during that time so it's not to

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,640
disturb the speaker

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,039
at the end we'll have a 10 to 15 minute

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,679
question and discussion session and so

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,840
please

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
raise your hands through zoom and we'll

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
invite you to

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,760
unmute your microphone and ask your

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,239
question um but if you don't want to

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,440
ask an oral question we will take

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,079
questions through the

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,559
chat window and so please just add a

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
little

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,360
no mic to your question and either

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,079
myself or one of the other conveners

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
will

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,160
read out the question for you um and

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
since these are seminars we're all

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
saying at home

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
uh if you do have to go halfway through

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,520
it by all means

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
just go it's not an issue at all and at

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
the very end

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
we will have a bit of time to catch up

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
with everybody

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
and just have a bit of socializing which

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,080
uh will not actually be

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,040
uh recorded so

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,799
um without further ado i will pass on to

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,840
courtney sprain who will be talking

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,840
uh today about clinkers

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,799
yeah thanks for that greg can you all

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
see my screen

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
yep

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
pointer options excellent okay

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
um so today i want to talk to you guys

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
about a passion project that i've been

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
working on for the last couple of years

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
and that is trying to magnetically

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
characterize

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,799
clinker deposits by the end of this

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
presentation i'm hoping that you guys

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,560
will

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,159
a learn what a clanker deposit is b

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
believe me that they are reliable

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,920
recorders of earth's magnetic field

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,840
and also that they provide a really neat

57
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
new option for filling in some of the

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
gaps that we have in the paleomagnetic

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,239
database

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,599
um and so this work has been in

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,560
collaboration with a lot of different

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,560
people

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
andy biggin was kind enough to let me

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,360
start working on this during my post-doc

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,319
at the university of liverpool a lot of

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,239
this work was

67
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,400
done through a visiting fellowship to

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
the institute for rock magnetism

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
in addition to having an undergrad there

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,360
riley lammers

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,879
who performed a lot of this work for her

72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
senior thesis

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,160
and now this work is continuing at the

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,800
university of florida which is where i

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
am today

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,720
so paleomagnetic data and

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
a large spot of paleomagnetic data is

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
necessary to capture

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,640
long-term variations in earth's magnetic

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
field through geologic history

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
and this can tell us some really

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
important information about the

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
evolution of the earth

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,720
from magnetohydrodynamic processes that

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,920
are occurring in the outer core

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
and then it also has important

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,840
implications for things outside

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,560
of earth including

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,319
it deflects the solar wind understanding

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,040
magnetic field has implications for

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,239
production rates of cosmogenic nuclides

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,599
and additionally has important

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,879
implications for the evolution of

94
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
earth's deep interior

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,000
and then also ultimately habitability in

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
my particular research i'm interested in

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
understanding long-term variations in

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,720
earth's magnetic field these are

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,159
variations occurring on the order of a

100
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
million years or longer

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,519
and how we can tie these long-term

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
variations

103
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,640
to processes that are occurring in the

104
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,680
deep interior

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,159
but in order to do this we first need to

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
have

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680
a reliable characterization of the

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,319
recent field where recent here

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,480
is the past 10 million years and this

110
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,640
reliable characterization is necessary

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,640
because we need something to compare

112
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,680
these other data sets too to determine

113
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,680
whether or not

114
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,239
they're different than kind of this

115
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
known average

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,159
and so looking at what we have for

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
recent periods

118
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,000
in earth's history of magnetic data it's

119
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,000
kind of divided into two

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,920
two different groups so first we have

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,760
our global time dependent field models

122
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
and so these have

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,799
done a really great job of

124
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,959
characterizing the magnetic field for

125
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,720
much of the holocene and additionally

126
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
the study came out a couple of years ago

127
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,520
in 2018

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
the ggf-100k model which extends these

129
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,880
global time dependent field models

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
back to a hundred thousand years ago

131
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,800
this is a really big effort

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,400
um and really amazing seat by this team

133
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
and so this record does a really good

134
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
job of characterizing some important

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
features of earth's magnetic field

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
including excursions

137
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
but there are many ways in which this

138
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120
record can be

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,560
improved and so one of them is we can

140
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,400
kind of look at this map of where the

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,120
data distribution is for the data that

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,880
went into ggf 100k

143
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,680
and what we can see here is all these

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,479
diamonds are sediment cores

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,880
the green dots are volcanic records and

146
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,800
then

147
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,400
the red dots are volcanic and

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
archaeological records

149
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,680
and so first you'll see there are quite

150
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,120
a few data gaps particularly in the

151
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,720
middle of continents

152
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,080
and then also we see even in the middle

153
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
continents where we do have data

154
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,520
basically beyond 10 000 years a lot of

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
this data is missing

156
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,639
once we move beyond the archaeological

157
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,440
record

158
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
this is also important for understanding

159
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,039
intensity

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,600
changes um so a lot of the intensity

161
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,280
records that exist in ggf-100k are from

162
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
these archaeological records

163
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,440
over 90 percent of the paleo intensity

164
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,199
data that went into this model

165
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,199
is from these archaeological records

166
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,400
that are less than 10 000 years old

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,479
and so we're really missing um a

168
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
big picture of what was going on with

169
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,520
intensity

170
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
um for much of this record because we

171
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
don't have high quality paleo intensity

172
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,199
data

173
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,919
from volcanic records um nicely

174
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,919
distributed throughout the world

175
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,520
now going back further in time we don't

176
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,759
have these global time dependent field

177
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,240
models instead we have global data sets

178
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,280
of time average field and so one

179
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
particular data set

180
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
that recently was published is the psv10

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
dataset which is a data set that

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,800
compiles

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,440
directional data only from volcanic

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,319
rocks for the last 10 million years

185
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,919
and so this is a map of where the data

186
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,319
is distributed and as you can see

187
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,319
there's

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
pretty good global coverage but we still

189
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,440
do have some gaps in the center of

190
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,120
continents

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,120
and then another important feature of

192
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,080
this is this data set is looking at

193
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,360
directions

194
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,000
only so we're really missing variation

195
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
in

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,919
intensity and in many cases or in some

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
cases that can

198
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
this can ultimately bias our view of

199
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,160
what was going on

200
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,680
on or for the magnetic field for these

201
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
time periods because we don't have a

202
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,199
full vector record

203
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,720
and so ideally we'd like to be able to

204
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,639
extend these types of global time

205
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,199
dependent field models further back in

206
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
time

207
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,880
we'd like to be able to connect between

208
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
the two we'd like to be able to fill in

209
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
these gaps

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,039
and we like to be able to fill in more

211
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,199
intensity data

212
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,800
but to do this we need more data i've

213
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,479
said this a lot during

214
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,960
this introduction there are a lot of

215
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,599
data gaps particularly intensity and in

216
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,599
order to

217
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,960
extend any of these models further back

218
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
in time

219
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,280
we we need more high quality paleo

220
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
intensity data

221
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,880
and so one opportunity to try to fill in

222
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
some of these gaps in the recent

223
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
magnetic record

224
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,680
is clinker deposits and so you're

225
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,360
probably thinking

226
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,560
what the heck is a clunker deposit

227
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,319
yeah exactly so clanky deposit clinkers

228
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
are a suite of metamorphic rocks that

229
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,599
have been baked

230
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,280
welded and or melted by natural burning

231
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,199
of underlying coal seams

232
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,360
um so there's this they're this special

233
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,680
suite of pyro metamorphic rocks

234
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
meaning they're metamorphosed by fire

235
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,840
and so basically what happens

236
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
is we're in this say here we have a

237
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,120
fluvial

238
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,120
deposit uh where we have this coal seam

239
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,080
that's exposed at the surface

240
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,000
this coal seam can ignite at the surface

241
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
due to processes such as spontaneous

242
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,319
combustion

243
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,039
lightning wildfires a human activity if

244
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,759
you're burning a cornfield for example

245
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,680
and then this burning starts basically

246
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,400
once it consumes this cold starts moving

247
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,520
backwards

248
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,039
into the outcrop and as it's moving

249
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,720
backwards into the outcrop it's

250
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
consuming that coal

251
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,639
it's reaching really really really high

252
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,240
temperatures and it's baking

253
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,120
all of the sediment and the material

254
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,039
around it and it is this baked material

255
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,440
this baked sediment that once was

256
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,240
overlying these coal seams that now no

257
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,200
longer exist

258
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,000
because they've been burnt up that are

259
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,279
what makes up

260
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,599
clinker deposits

261
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,640
and so clinker the term clinker actually

262
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
refers to

263
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,600
all products from this type of reaction

264
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,680
and so it's not just referring to a

265
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
particular clinker lithology

266
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,440
and so in general these types of

267
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,959
products can be divided into a couple of

268
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,920
different groups depending on

269
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,680
initial lithology and also depending on

270
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,519
things like temperature reached

271
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,600
and oxidation state and so

272
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,600
broadly there are three categories of

273
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,640
clinker lithologies we have our baked

274
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
sediment

275
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
these are parts of the planker that have

276
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,120
been heated to the lowest temperatures

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,600
around 300 to 800 degrees c

278
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,279
we then have porcelainite these are

279
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
baked to intermediate temperatures of

280
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,480
600 to 1400 degrees c

281
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,240
and then finally we have para lavas

282
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,839
which are effectively melted

283
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,200
rock so these are melts that have been

284
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,680
crystallized so these are basically

285
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,839
new igneous rocks and these have reached

286
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,160
extremely high temperatures of 1500 to

287
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,959
2000 degrees celsius

288
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,240
and so broadly these differ both by

289
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,880
temperature formation

290
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,880
but also baked sediment tends to involve

291
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,720
lithologies that started as sandstones

292
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
or siltstones generally these coarser

293
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,480
lithologies

294
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,160
and porcelainite generally started as

295
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,519
things like shtails

296
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,760
and within all of these different

297
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,880
deposits there's an array of oxidation

298
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,959
states

299
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,560
so you can either have really oxidizing

300
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,440
conditions and get really red

301
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,120
really orange deposits and you can also

302
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,600
have reducing conditions

303
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
that produce things like these kind of

304
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
dark purple to black

305
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,880
colored rocks and these parallels really

306
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,079
hot temperatures generally form in these

307
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,920
chimneys

308
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,360
which are regions where these hot gases

309
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,959
from the burning of coal are trying to

310
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,519
reach the surface and they're convecting

311
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,880
within these regions

312
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
and so why do um why might clinkers be

313
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,480
good for

314
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,160
for paleomagnetism so first clinkers can

315
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,920
be reliably dated

316
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,519
and so clinkers are not the same age as

317
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,200
the sediments around them you don't

318
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,640
normally start getting burning of coal

319
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
seams until these coal seams have

320
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,160
reached earth's surface

321
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,000
and so that's many millions of years

322
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
after the formation of these sedimentary

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,079
deposits

324
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
and so clinkers have been reliably dated

325
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
using

326
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,680
fission track also uranium during helium

327
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,480
dating and argon argon geochronology

328
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,560
and then clinkers also because they

329
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
don't start burning until

330
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,880
they're close to earth's surface these

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,680
coal seams tend to be

332
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,640
recent time and age covering the last 5

333
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,720
million years

334
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
to 10 million years and so in the powder

335
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
river basin alone

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
this is a basin that's between montana

337
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,240
and wyoming in

338
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,040
western united states clinkers cover

339
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,480
basically the last 4 million years so

340
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,079
there are coal seams that are still

341
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,920
burning today

342
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,680
and actually this whole region is called

343
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
the powder river basin from the powder

344
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
river

345
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
which was called the powder river

346
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,800
because when loose and clark came upon

347
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
this area

348
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,320
they thought it smelled like gun powder

349
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
because

350
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,760
of the burning of these coal seam

351
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,800
deposits

352
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,320
in siberia deposits range from 0 to 1.2

353
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,440
million years in age of the deposits

354
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,519
have been dated in china we have

355
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
deposits ranging through the pleistocene

356
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
and then in israel we have some of our

357
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
older clinker

358
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
deposits which are min myosin to

359
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,800
plyocene and age

360
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,279
and so an additional advantage of

361
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,120
studying clinker deposits is they also

362
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,120
not only offer an opportunity to kind of

363
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
study this period of interest this kind

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,120
of zero to five

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,480
million years in age um they also offer

366
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,200
the opportunity to

367
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,279
do this at high resolution so basically

368
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
a clinker deposit as it

369
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,639
is formed will start where coal is

370
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,120
burning at the surface and then it will

371
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,720
continually form as this fire extends

372
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,760
back into the outcrop

373
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,160
a single coal seam fire can burn for

374
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,959
thousands to tens of thousands of years

375
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,600
as is extending back into the outcrop

376
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,079
and so if we're able to obtain samples

377
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
all across this plateau

378
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,040
or we might be able to see changes in

379
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,320
the magnetic field with really high

380
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,079
resolution

381
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,079
for periods of about 10 000 years

382
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,839
an additional reason why these might be

383
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,560
good for paleomagnetism is they're wide

384
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,720
spread

385
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,639
so this is a map of modern coal seam

386
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,399
fires which are shown as red dots and

387
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,240
then clinker deposits which are shown as

388
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,160
these pink dots

389
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
and so clinker deposits have been found

390
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
in continental interiors this is

391
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,079
generally where we have these large

392
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,519
sedimentary basins which coal seams

393
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,839
and they have a wide geographic

394
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,000
distribution they've been identified in

395
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,040
at least 15 countries

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,040
and as you can see if we

397
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,360
bring back up the maps of where data was

398
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,839
distributed in

399
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,000
ggf-100k and also psv10 we see that some

400
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,240
of the distribution of clinker deposits

401
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
helps kind of fill in some of these gaps

402
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,120
that we have in the interior of these

403
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,639
continents

404
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,399
additionally providing some high

405
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,639
latitude sites

406
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
and possibly some new sites in south

407
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
america

408
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
and australia

409
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
and so why else might they be good for

410
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,120
paleomagnetism

411
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,720
and so one of the reasons they might be

412
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,240
good for paleomagnetism

413
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,320
is the process by which they're formed

414
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,560
is really really similar to the process

415
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,639
of the formation of archaeological

416
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
materials or these baked archaeological

417
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,680
materials

418
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
so it's basically the baking of

419
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
sediments and clays

420
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,480
to really really really high

421
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,079
temperatures which is basically turning

422
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
what used to be a detrital remnant

423
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,040
magnetization

424
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,440
into what should be a thermal or thermal

425
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,600
chemical remnant magnetization

426
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
if we look at the general ranges of

427
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,000
formation temperatures for

428
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,839
baked sediment to para lavas we see that

429
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,440
all of these have been reheated to at

430
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,959
least 300 degrees celsius

431
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,959
and considering that in a lot of these

432
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,519
deposits the primary

433
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,600
magnetic mineralogy is intermediate

434
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
titano hematite with low and blocking

435
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
temperatures

436
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
all of these products should be

437
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,760
reheating above

438
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,360
the curia temperatures of the mineralogy

439
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,920
that was originally there

440
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,959
and so at least resetting the drm and

441
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,160
whether or not it's a trm or a tcrm

442
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
i hope to show you by the end of this

443
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,440
talk

444
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
and another reason these might be good

445
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
is there have been past studies

446
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,880
looking at clinker deposit past

447
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,320
paleomagnetic studies that indicate

448
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,800
that they are reliable magnetic

449
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
recorders so jones at all and then a lot

450
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,560
of work done by rob sternberg and the

451
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
powder river basin and also in the

452
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,360
williston basin

453
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
there's been demagnetization work

454
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,480
showing that clinkers preserve

455
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,519
these basically univectorial

456
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,279
thyroid diagrams yielding really good

457
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,760
directional data

458
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,480
other work done by deborah in china has

459
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,160
shown that some of these products are

460
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,000
really thermally stable so in

461
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
thermo-magnetic experiments they don't

462
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,839
alter

463
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,839
there's been some work done for paleo

464
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
intensity on these types of deposits

465
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,480
in the czech republic these are

466
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,079
generally old studies so it's hard to

467
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,920
assess the reliability of the paleo

468
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,600
intensity results but looking at

469
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,600
this array diagram here we see it looks

470
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,880
pretty good this is a straight line

471
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
fitting these different components

472
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
whether or not there's alteration

473
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,360
will have to be seen because this didn't

474
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,600
use ptrm checks but it looks pretty good

475
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,120
and then also even in deposits in israel

476
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
we see that

477
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,639
they also found these kind of

478
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,800
univectorial directions

479
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,120
and they match expected directions for

480
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,839
the time of formation of these rocks

481
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,320
so these should be good for magnetic

482
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
studies

483
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
but one of the things the other studies

484
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,399
did not do is

485
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,079
look at a broad range of materials

486
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,839
within clinker deposits so clinkers are

487
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,759
really heterogeneous

488
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,160
so there's this wide variety of clinker

489
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,800
materials with a variation of oxidation

490
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
state

491
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,360
variation of clinker lithology we also

492
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,279
have variations in potential

493
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,560
temperatures of formations depending how

494
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,880
close you are to the old

495
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,000
coal seam um obviously hotter

496
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,600
temperatures are going to be closer to

497
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
the base cooler temperatures further

498
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,240
away

499
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,839
and so although these previous studies

500
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,839
have shown that clinkers have the

501
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
potential to be reliable recorders

502
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
it's still unclear which part of a

503
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,079
clanker

504
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,079
is good for paleomagnetic study and so

505
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,639
that's kind of the impetus and objective

506
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,279
of our work has been to assess the rock

507
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,560
and paleomagnetic behavior of clinkers

508
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,240
and this has been basically we've tried

509
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,120
to do this as a function of

510
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,480
lithology so focusing on variations that

511
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
we observe between

512
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,120
the different types of clinker

513
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,600
lithologies from baked sediment

514
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,360
porcelain to para lava

515
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880
we also looked at this as a function of

516
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,160
distance from the coal seam

517
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,400
by collecting a few profiles we looked

518
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,400
at this as a function of oxidation state

519
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,199
by grouping our results based on color

520
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,199
where darker colors tend to

521
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
be indicative of reducing states and

522
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,520
orange and red colors

523
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,360
are indicative of oxidizing states and

524
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,000
then also of location

525
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,080
so where we collected our samples we

526
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,559
studied whether or not we saw variations

527
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,480
on

528
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,240
between our clinker deposits and also

529
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,039
between different coal seams that they

530
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,520
were

531
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,520
burning coal seams that they represented

532
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,280
and so where we collected these deposits

533
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
was from the custer national forest this

534
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,919
is in

535
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,679
the northeastern powder river basin in

536
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,200
eastern montana

537
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,360
um and so these were clinker or these

538
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
clinker deposits had formed in paleocene

539
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,440
fluvial sediments

540
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,240
we collected 101 samples across this

541
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
region

542
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
this is a map here one of the reasons

543
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,320
this region was

544
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,320
selected is because this is one of the

545
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,600
few areas where clinker deposits have

546
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,679
actually been mapped

547
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,280
so we have these nice reliable maps

548
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,760
where we can expect to

549
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
find clinker deposits and additionally

550
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,679
these clinker deposits many of them in

551
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
this region have been dated already

552
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,840
using uranium during helium and also

553
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,960
fission track and so we were able to go

554
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,200
here

555
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
and to have this nice framework of where

556
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,840
to find the clinkers of known age

557
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,760
that really aided our study so we

558
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,160
collected 101 samples

559
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,120
from four data clinkers and five undated

560
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,440
clinkers

561
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,640
and we additionally sampled two profiles

562
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,600
extending

563
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,200
from the top of the clinker down to the

564
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,559
unbaked sediment below

565
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,320
and then also from the base of a clinker

566
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,080
up through unbig sediment above

567
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,000
and so to do this type of analysis we

568
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,120
performed a range of rock magnetic

569
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,160
experiments

570
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,200
i'm not going to go list these um

571
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,880
you can kind of see them here

572
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,039
we're basically we're trying to assess

573
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
differences in mineralogy but also grain

574
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,679
size

575
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,080
between all of these different clinker

576
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,080
products

577
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,919
and so let's start with variations in

578
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,679
lithology

579
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,600
so to look at variations in clinker

580
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
lithology we were

581
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
or divided our clinker deposits and our

582
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,520
results into different groups

583
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,440
um so we did this into big sediment

584
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,559
porcelain and para lava did

585
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,960
three main types of clinker lythologies

586
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,360
we also divide it into weekly baked one

587
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,760
of the profiles we collected

588
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,960
was through a recently burned coal seam

589
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,039
fire that

590
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
seemed to have extinguished relatively

591
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,039
rapidly

592
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,600
we could actually walk out the start of

593
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
this

594
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,440
clinker deposit around the corner to

595
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
where the coal had not burned

596
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,280
whereas these deposits were where the

597
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,320
clinker like up here was at the top of

598
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,039
the hill

599
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,320
it had burned for a long period of time

600
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,679
and created these strongly baked

601
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,919
equivalents

602
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,280
and then we also collected samples from

603
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,960
unbaked sediment

604
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,799
to kind of provide a baseline of what

605
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
these things looked like

606
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,559
before they were baked and so let's

607
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,039
quickly summarize our unbaked sediments

608
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,880
so our unbaked sediments had one primary

609
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,000
remnants carrier

610
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,240
and so we found that this was

611
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,600
titanomagnetite or intermediate titanic

612
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
hematite

613
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,240
and you'll understand why i say or

614
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,760
intermediate titanohaematate shortly

615
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,159
and so this was because they generally

616
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,440
had low coercivity ranges less than 100

617
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,960
ml tesla

618
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,280
and unblocking temperatures below 400

619
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,320
degrees around 300 degrees celsius so

620
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,600
consistent with

621
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,679
a soft mineral

622
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,159
with titanium in it to get these lower

623
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,919
curie temperatures

624
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
our weekly baked sediment had two

625
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,360
primary remnants carriers

626
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
so the first was also this titano

627
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,000
magnetite phase so we still

628
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,320
saw the softer component with low

629
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,039
median destructive fields around 32 mil

630
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
tesla

631
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,200
and then also low in blocking

632
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,720
temperatures less than 400 degrees

633
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,720
and we also saw this new component of

634
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,440
hematite as one would expect these rocks

635
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,039
are now red

636
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,039
when they were not red when we started

637
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,440
moving on to our baked sediment we had

638
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,440
two primary remnants carriers

639
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,120
uh so now one of our remnants carriers

640
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,080
is magnetite it's not the titanium

641
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,280
magnetite

642
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,960
um this had generally both a low

643
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,720
and a high correctivity component one

644
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
that was less than 100 ml tesla and one

645
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,799
that was greater than 100 ml of tesla

646
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,360
with unblocking temperatures between 400

647
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,880
and 590 degrees celsius

648
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,000
and we additionally have this high

649
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,600
coercivity thermally stable phase

650
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,480
this hcslt phase so this phase had

651
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,039
coercivities that were above one tesla

652
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
and had curie temperatures around 220

653
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,360
degrees celsius

654
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,520
with relatively high magnetizations

655
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,520
and then we also had some minor carriers

656
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,200
observed in our baked sediment

657
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
including this intermediate titanium

658
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,400
hematite

659
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,400
and also regular hematite

660
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,960
looking at perselonite we also had two

661
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,880
primary remnant carriers

662
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,600
again very similar to our bank sediment

663
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,240
we had this magnetite with two variants

664
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,080
both low and high coercivity we also had

665
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,320
this hcslt

666
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,919
phase and then we had minor carriers

667
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,120
that were intermediate titanic hematite

668
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,679
and then also regular hematite

669
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,440
now moving on to pear lavas para lavas

670
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,360
were quite different they only had one

671
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,320
primary remnants carrier and that was

672
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,400
magnetite

673
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,400
um and so this tended to be our higher

674
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,679
coefficient component of magnetite

675
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,360
which are with um conversivity levels

676
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,360
less than 100 ml tesla

677
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,440
and also these had generally pretty

678
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,080
distinct unblocking ranges

679
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,039
around 575 degrees celsius so very

680
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,000
consistent with

681
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,760
low titanium magnetite we also observed

682
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,039
some minor carriers so we did see

683
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,039
evidence for the hcslt phase

684
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,960
in some samples that still kind of had

685
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,159
these blocks of baked sediment within

686
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,840
them

687
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,159
and then we also saw evidence for some

688
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,080
hematite

689
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,919
and we also saw evidence for a phase

690
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,480
that had an unblocking temperature above

691
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,640
700 degrees celsius

692
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,880
and considering the odd nature in which

693
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,760
parallels form

694
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,240
this could be a really interesting

695
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,360
magnetic phase

696
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,720
so now i'm going to walk through some of

697
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
the evidence that led us to these

698
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,640
conclusions

699
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,799
and some of the it's not all of our data

700
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,200
we had a lot of data

701
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,600
but these are the results that led us to

702
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,320
these conclusions the most strongly

703
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,080
and so the first one is we're going to

704
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,840
look at hysteresis properties

705
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
so these are some hysteresis loops for

706
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,279
different types of materials that

707
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,120
we talked about previously so we have

708
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,480
perselonate two examples of big

709
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
sandstone and then an example of

710
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,960
parallel

711
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,880
and so what we see is within our baked

712
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,080
materials including procellonite and our

713
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,480
baked sandstones

714
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,440
we kind of have this bimodal coercivity

715
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,840
range

716
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,919
so we have both evidence for this really

717
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,159
high coercivity

718
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:13,120
phase that was really really hard had

719
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,279
conversivities above one tesla and then

720
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,039
we also see evidence example of the big

721
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,640
sandstone that this phase has a very

722
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,080
high magnetization

723
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,760
which would be too high for hematite

724
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,039
in this example the bake sandstone down

725
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,799
here we have a really wasp wasted curve

726
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,640
which is showing our sharply bimodal

727
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,880
distribution between that magnetite

728
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,159
phase but also this higher coercivity

729
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
phase

730
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,000
and then in parallavas we don't really

731
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,640
see evidence for this hard component

732
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,440
we see this dominantly soft curve which

733
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,520
is indicative

734
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,039
of remnants being carried by mostly

735
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,159
magnetite

736
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,919
and so this by modality that we saw

737
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,520
in our baked materials both a big

738
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,520
sandstone and porcelain

739
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,919
can also be recognized by looking at

740
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,760
sigma values

741
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,240
where the high values are indicating a

742
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,919
more wasted curve

743
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
and so we say our pair of lavas are

744
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,720
dominantly kind of ranging around

745
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,840
zero indicative of having basically this

746
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,840
one phase

747
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
where baked sediment and our perselonite

748
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
have higher sigma values

749
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,799
indicative of this bimodality of

750
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,159
coercivity

751
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,320
of the minerals that are within these

752
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:24,640
samples and this kind of wasp wastedness

753
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,240
so moving on to looking at the day plot

754
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
and then also the squareness versus

755
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,679
coercivity plot we can see a few more

756
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,880
trends by combining all of our data

757
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,840
together

758
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,840
so on these plots the colors indicate

759
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,480
the different type of lithology

760
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,360
where blue is para lava green is our

761
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,679
baked sediment

762
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,400
orange is porcelainite and this pink is

763
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,080
unbaked

764
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,000
and they also have a brettcher component

765
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,640
which is we didn't collect enough of it

766
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,400
to indicate it as its own category

767
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
but we did sample one of them so we

768
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,440
included it on this plot

769
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,279
and so basically what we can see from

770
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,360
these plots is

771
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,880
first of all our bake sediment and our

772
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,360
porcelain generally have

773
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,559
really high mr versus miss ratios and

774
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,440
also

775
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,200
bcr versus bc so this really high

776
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,520
coercivity range they're extending

777
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,120
really far in this direction

778
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,039
and then also really far in this

779
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
direction and they're the furthest away

780
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,400
from

781
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,919
our magnetite mixing curves we see the

782
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,679
same thing looking at the squareness

783
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,840
versus coercivity plot

784
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,200
where we do have some falling in between

785
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,640
these

786
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,960
tm-60 and magnetite curves but a lot of

787
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,080
the data is actually plotting to

788
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,480
the right at higher coercivity values

789
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,240
our para lavas and our unbaked sediment

790
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,360
are plotting closest to these mixing

791
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,679
lines

792
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,279
not quite on top of them but more

793
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,240
indicative basically that these two

794
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,840
phases have more magnetite

795
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,120
that one would traditionally expect if

796
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,120
it's falling along these lines

797
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,080
so now looking at our results from the

798
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,960
arm acquisition and demagnetization

799
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
experiments

800
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,640
because we had this high coercivity

801
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,600
phase we could not treat

802
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,440
the arm data on its own and so instead

803
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,159
in order to calculate median destructive

804
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,320
fields

805
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,679
we calculated the vector difference sum

806
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,279
or difference

807
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,360
vector difference on the magnetization

808
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,679
vector for each sample and then from

809
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,840
this

810
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,760
calculated the median destructive field

811
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,440
and so this effectively was able to kind

812
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,039
of mask out the remaining high

813
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,640
coercivity component that did not

814
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,960
acquire an arm

815
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,320
and that was remaining after

816
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,480
demagnetization and then we also

817
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,440
calculated percent hc or percent high

818
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
coercivity

819
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,600
which is the percent of remnants that

820
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,960
was remaining after the 170 ml tesla af

821
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,039
step

822
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,880
and so looking at our plots uh this is

823
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,240
median destructive field versus this is

824
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,000
the

825
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,039
arm of the component that's already been

826
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,919
filtered out

827
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,919
for this high coercivity step um and

828
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,080
then we have over here percent hc versus

829
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,679
that same arm component

830
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,360
and so by looking at these plots again

831
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,880
the colors indicate the same differences

832
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,120
in lithology

833
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,039
we can see that the lowest median

834
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,279
destructive fields

835
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,320
are in our unbaked and weakly baked

836
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,559
samples

837
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,559
and also that these unbaked and weekly

838
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,679
baked samples had the lowest arms

839
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,000
so the lowest magnetizations whereas

840
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,159
our baked samples as we're moving into

841
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
baked sediment and porcelain

842
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,279
we start increasing our median

843
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,760
destructive fields

844
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,440
and increasing our arms so increasing

845
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,600
our magnetizations

846
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,279
looking at percent hc we also see that

847
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,679
our unbaked and weekly baked samples

848
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,000
have

849
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,480
really low percent hc so they don't have

850
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,159
this high coercivity phase and we start

851
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,600
seeing this increase in high coercivity

852
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,120
phase again

853
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,960
when we're looking at our big sediment

854
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,240
barcelonite samples

855
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,120
para lavas kind of plot in different

856
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,640
areas with both low and high median

857
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,399
destructive fields

858
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,080
and moderate to low percent hcs

859
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,760
and some of these moderate ones may be

860
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,039
biased by having some chunks of baked

861
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,039
material within them as well

862
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,799
and so in order to get a better

863
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
constraint

864
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,360
on what was actually carrying this high

865
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
coercivity phase we performed a modified

866
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,559
lowry test

867
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,840
and so what do i mean by modified lowry

868
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,960
test well by modified lowry test i mean

869
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,960
that instead of applying

870
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,360
that basically instead of doing a

871
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,919
thermal demagnetization of

872
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,640
arms we did an afd magnetization of trms

873
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,240
and so we applied three different trms

874
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,360
one at 700 degrees

875
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,640
uh one at 600 and one at 300 and then

876
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,320
af demagnetize them up to 170 ml tesla

877
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,880
and so in this way we were better able

878
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,240
to capture um

879
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,320
this this behavior between our

880
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,000
coercivity and also on blocking

881
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,440
and so by looking at the results from

882
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,919
this plot we can see that

883
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,360
our baked sediment we both have

884
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,480
dominant phases being this three

885
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,159
anything less than 300 degrees in some

886
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,080
samples it's

887
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,840
samples with remnants between three are

888
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,520
unblocking temperatures between 300 and

889
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,880
600 degrees c

890
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,960
so this would be indicative of kind of

891
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,520
our magnetite phase this would be

892
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,200
our hcslt phase

893
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,960
and then in the sample here this orange

894
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,960
baked salt stone we kind of see a mix in

895
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,679
between where we have both

896
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,360
remnants held in this intermediate and

897
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,480
blocking range and also this higher in

898
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,919
blocking range

899
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,840
and none of our samples did we see a

900
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,320
strong component of magnetization held

901
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,600
greater in the 700 phase so not a strong

902
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,799
component of magnetization held by

903
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,640
hematite

904
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,080
um and then in our baked para lava we

905
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,760
see that most of the remnants is being

906
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,159
held by this

907
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,840
greater than or the 600 phase so between

908
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,440
300 600 so this would be

909
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,200
indicative of most of the remnants being

910
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,840
held by magnetite

911
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,360
um and another observation that we can

912
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,559
make looking at this plot

913
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,039
is that this 300 phase does not fully

914
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,600
demagnetize by 170 ml of tesla

915
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:58,559
so this is indeed holding on to our

916
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,159
hgslt phase another odd observation of

917
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,120
these plots is we have this little

918
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,720
dip here where we start losing remnants

919
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,600
and then gaining it again

920
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,039
indicative of something acquiring a

921
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
field during these experiments in the

922
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,679
opposite direction of what was applied

923
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,679
and so this might be indicative of

924
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,600
intermediate titanium hematite

925
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,360
this mineral has been found in similar

926
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,840
age sedimentary deposits

927
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,919
in northeastern montana and so it's

928
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,640
possible that it's in these deposits as

929
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,880
well

930
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,919
and then was accumulated and acquired

931
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,039
into

932
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,360
these clinker deposits

933
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,039
and so i'm kind of going to brush over

934
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,919
some of the hot or the susceptibility

935
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,320
results

936
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,399
um but basically the things i want you

937
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,720
to take away from these results

938
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,559
are as with heating so we have unbaked

939
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,760
here weekly baked

940
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,840
baked perselonite para lava para lava

941
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,080
as we move with increasing temperatures

942
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,000
increasing degree of being baked

943
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,519
we start having curves that once weren't

944
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,159
reversible and altered

945
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,440
becoming more reversible indicating that

946
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,640
these are becoming more

947
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,480
thermally stable what we're also seeing

948
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,240
is we have some evidence here for this

949
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,960
low and blocking phase this is probably

950
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,399
alteration

951
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,080
and then as we move into our baked

952
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,440
materials we see evidence for this

953
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,200
magnetite phase

954
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,960
but we don't really see evidence for the

955
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,120
hcslt phase

956
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,240
where we'd expect to see so we don't see

957
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,519
this on blocking around 200 degrees

958
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,000
and then this is the example of that

959
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,919
parallava sample where we have

960
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,760
this weird high temperature phase

961
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,320
that still has remnants above 700

962
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,320
degrees celsius

963
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,919
and so in order to better understand

964
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,360
where we are losing our

965
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,159
remnants we performed high temperature

966
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,720
hysteresis

967
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,279
experiments where we measured hysteresis

968
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,039
loops

969
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,279
with increasing temperatures from room

970
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,159
temperature up to 600

971
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,240
or 700 degrees celsius and so what we

972
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,039
can see is first we have this transition

973
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
from these

974
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,960
wasted curves down to kind of these soft

975
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,360
curves

976
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,640
and then finally into more harder curves

977
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,399
which are hard to see here but you can

978
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,559
see it really here in the transition

979
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,080
of looking at coercivity we have

980
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,960
coercivity decreasing

981
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,640
through this 220 degree phase further

982
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,159
decreasing through the magnetite carry

983
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,480
temperature but then after we remove

984
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,200
magnetite it's steeply increasing again

985
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,960
which is indicative of hemotype we also

986
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,120
see here looking at this plot

987
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,679
looking at magnetization we do have this

988
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,799
nice

989
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,600
decrease in magnetization uh that

990
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,720
has this abrupt kind of change at 220

991
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,320
degrees celsius

992
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,840
and so this is our hcslt phase

993
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,240
and looking at the same thing and

994
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,200
susceptibility we don't see it here

995
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,559
indicating that whatever is causing this

996
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
change

997
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,640
um doesn't have a large susceptibility

998
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,919
change

999
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,399
and so the next thing we wanted to do

1000
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,760
was constrain the um

1001
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,640
grain size of these samples and so we

1002
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,080
did this by

1003
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,679
performing fork analyses and so we saw

1004
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,279
these broad ranges of behavior of our

1005
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,200
fork analyses so these are both baked

1006
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,320
sediment this is porcelain this is para

1007
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
lava

1008
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,359
in our baked sediment and our

1009
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,119
purcellinate we saw kind of two

1010
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,000
different groupings

1011
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,359
of behaviors so one was this kind of

1012
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,599
grouping where we had these strong

1013
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,960
coercivity peaks extending out to 5 to

1014
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,599
40 ml of tesla

1015
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,720
and then also these kind of inner weak

1016
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,440
interacting

1017
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,359
or interaction uh fields extending out

1018
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,760
plus minus 20 ml of tesla

1019
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,359
similar here in this perspective sample

1020
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,240
but then we also had this other grouping

1021
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,599
which had this huge high coverage detail

1022
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,599
which is indicative of our hcslt phase

1023
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,359
in the para lavas we also saw the strong

1024
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,240
coercivity peak between 5 and 20

1025
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,480
millitessa

1026
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,599
but we also saw much larger interaction

1027
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,800
fields

1028
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,320
and so in general this kind of looks psd

1029
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,399
like

1030
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,520
probably slightly larger grain sizes in

1031
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,119
these components

1032
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,599
but it's kind of hard to tell whether or

1033
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,680
not these are

1034
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,680
the real behavior considering they are

1035
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,440
generally this one is definitely masked

1036
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,119
by this high coaster detail

1037
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,079
and these ones might be biased by it as

1038
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,240
well because we know that phase exists

1039
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,440
and so to get a clearer picture of this

1040
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,720
we decided to

1041
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,040
run high temperature forks and so

1042
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,720
what we did is we ran a fork analysis

1043
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,119
preheating at room temperature

1044
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,680
a standard fork analysis we ran another

1045
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,119
fork analysis at 250 degrees c

1046
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,960
and then we ran another one again at

1047
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,119
room temperature post heating

1048
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,680
and so what we can see here is after

1049
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,480
this 250 degree temperature step

1050
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,880
this high coercivity phase is lost and

1051
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,720
so

1052
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,400
so now we're basically seeing through

1053
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,880
that high coercivity phase

1054
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,880
and we can see evidence of what the

1055
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,160
grain size population is

1056
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,079
for this softer phase and so it's kind

1057
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,440
of it's psd like

1058
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,359
and then what we can also see is the

1059
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,079
comparison between preheating and post

1060
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,240
heating

1061
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,440
and generally the fork diagrams look the

1062
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,320
same there's

1063
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,760
some shifting in this direction so it

1064
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,960
might be slightly altering

1065
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,160
but generally they're magnetically

1066
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,599
thermal thermally stable so we did this

1067
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,640
for a couple more samples

1068
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,320
very similar behavior this 250 degree

1069
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,960
temperature step is removing this high

1070
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,520
coercivity phase

1071
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,079
and so jumping into changes in color i'm

1072
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,400
just going to

1073
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,920
quickly run through this we broadly

1074
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,680
divided our stuff into whether it was

1075
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,520
red and orange oxidizing

1076
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,359
black and purple reducing and yellow was

1077
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,040
unbaked

1078
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,960
and so looking at these results for

1079
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,640
colors indicating the color

1080
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,119
we can see our red and orange samples

1081
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,119
have the higher mr versus miss and vcr

1082
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,839
versus bc ratios

1083
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,839
and also higher coercivity values

1084
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:47,119
indicating that this hls

1085
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,640
hcslt phase is in oxidizing conditions

1086
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,320
we also have this black purple and

1087
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,920
yellow samples plotting closer to these

1088
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,359
expected mixing lines

1089
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,040
suggesting they have more magnetite

1090
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,520
this corroborated by looking at our

1091
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,520
sigma values our black samples tend to

1092
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,040
have the lower sigma values and our red

1093
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,680
and orange tend to have the highest

1094
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,640
indicating that they have mixtures of

1095
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,480
different coercivity components

1096
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,320
and then looking at our percent hc we

1097
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,480
see our red and our orange samples have

1098
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,160
the highest percent hc and the highest

1099
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,599
amount of this hcslt

1100
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,800
phase and also of hematite and then our

1101
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,119
orange

1102
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,079
samples have the highest so maybe orange

1103
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,280
is

1104
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,040
indicating the color of the space and so

1105
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,880
to summarize our orange and red have

1106
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,599
more abundance of this high coarsivity

1107
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,599
phase

1108
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,599
and purple and black are more abundant

1109
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,680
in magnetite

1110
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,920
so now looking at comparisons by

1111
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,680
distance from the coal seam fire

1112
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,680
um so what we did is basically we

1113
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,240
collected two profiles one this is

1114
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,920
through a

1115
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,440
or weekly baked profile starting at

1116
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,040
the base of where the coal seam was and

1117
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,960
then extending multiple meters

1118
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,240
up and this one we did the opposite

1119
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,760
where we started at the top of the

1120
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
plateau that had a strongly baked

1121
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,079
clinker

1122
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,839
and we worked down into the unbaked

1123
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,119
sediments below

1124
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,040
and so some of the things that we can

1125
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,960
see looking at these

1126
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,040
curves is first within

1127
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,160
a clinker there does not appear to be

1128
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,760
any

1129
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,520
observable variation of magnetic

1130
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,280
properties with distance

1131
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,119
so we do see our percent hc

1132
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,119
changing but it's relatively high

1133
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,800
throughout uh same with our median

1134
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,320
destructive field

1135
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,800
um we do see however large variations in

1136
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,400
unbaked coal or sediment below the coal

1137
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,720
seam immediately below

1138
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,560
we see these stark changes immediately

1139
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,320
in percent hc and also in medium

1140
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,920
destructive field

1141
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,839
and we see a slight difference also

1142
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,480
between weakly baked and

1143
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,280
unbaked sediment as well but it's not as

1144
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,160
strong

1145
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,359
a slight shift in medium destructive

1146
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,000
fields but it's not as well developed

1147
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,040
and so moving on to location we broadly

1148
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,119
grouped it into

1149
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,880
just locality and then also different

1150
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,760
types of coal seams so these clinkers

1151
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,800
are formed and

1152
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,359
mapped cool seams that broadly represent

1153
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,640
primary sediments of a different age and

1154
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,839
so first just looking at all of our

1155
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,480
different sites

1156
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,920
we don't see a broad difference in

1157
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,480
magnetic properties as a function of

1158
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,720
locality that's not already described by

1159
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,520
clinker lithologies very similar ranges

1160
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,040
in each deposit we collected

1161
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,880
and then same for the different coal

1162
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,400
zones we don't really see a variation in

1163
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,640
magnetic properties between the coal

1164
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,440
zones as well

1165
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,200
and so to summarize our primary controls

1166
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,880
on magnetic properties appear to be

1167
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,960
clinker lithology

1168
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,560
um so if it's para lava versus baked

1169
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,800
material

1170
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,520
and also oxidation state where it's more

1171
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,359
reduced there's more magnetite

1172
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,599
we don't see magnetic properties being a

1173
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,839
function of primary lithology

1174
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,760
so whether or not it was a mudstone or a

1175
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,119
sandstone that you were making

1176
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,440
distance from the coal seam which is

1177
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,440
kind of shocking and then also location

1178
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,599
and so one thing that we needed to

1179
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,839
figure out was what is this hcslt

1180
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,800
phase and we believe that it is epsilon

1181
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,960
hematite

1182
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,680
or lugo fungite which i am totally

1183
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,000
butchering the name of

1184
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,520
and so why is this so the observed

1185
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,040
characteristics of the phase that we

1186
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,160
identified on our deposits is they have

1187
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,480
high coercivity

1188
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,680
so above one tesla they have low on

1189
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,359
blocking between 180 and 220 degrees c

1190
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,359
they have high magnetization higher than

1191
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,560
one would expect for hemotype

1192
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,240
they are thermally stable and it's

1193
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,000
really similar in properties to the

1194
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,280
epsilon hematite phase that was observed

1195
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,079
in baked archaeological

1196
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,800
materials first identified by mcintosh

1197
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,560
and then

1198
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,920
later confirmed by lopez sanchez in

1199
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,520
2016.

1200
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,760
and so as we can see all of these

1201
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,440
different properties nicely match this

1202
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
epsilon hematite phase down here

1203
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,680
just a reminder of time courtney yep no

1204
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,560
i'm watching i'll be done in two minutes

1205
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,319
but thank you and so we can kind of

1206
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,680
summarize how do clinkers

1207
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:01,359
get their magnetization so first we have

1208
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:04,720
this change of drm into either a tcrm

1209
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,720
or a trm due to heating we also see an

1210
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,359
ingrowth of pneumatic materials that's

1211
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,040
either going to be a trm or a serum

1212
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,640
in our weekly baked clinker deposits we

1213
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,400
have an ingrowth of magnetite

1214
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,240
which is causing enhanced magnetization

1215
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,000
this is possibly a trm but it could be a

1216
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,680
tcrm

1217
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,400
in our strongly baked deposits we have

1218
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,000
more magnetite uh we start forming this

1219
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,400
epsilon hematite phase

1220
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,079
this epsilon hematite phase in both

1221
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,440
laboratory experiments and also in

1222
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,359
experiments forming this phase and

1223
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,599
archaeological materials only forms at

1224
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,400
high temperatures above 600 c

1225
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,079
so this is likely holding a trm and

1226
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,000
because we don't see

1227
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,920
really any variation in where we're

1228
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,359
finding this epsilon hematite phase from

1229
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,440
distance from the coal seam

1230
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,520
we find it as much as eight meters away

1231
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
it suggests that basically this entire

1232
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,119
thickness

1233
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,560
of a clinker could have a trm

1234
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,839
and then finally our para lavas these

1235
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,960
are melted rocks they're mostly

1236
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,880
magnetite

1237
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,160
um because they're melted and we're

1238
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,960
heated to 1000 c

1239
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,720
they likely hold the tierra and so to

1240
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,640
summarize what this means for future

1241
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,720
studies on paleo directions

1242
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,560
uh the primary drm should be reset for

1243
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,839
paleo directions mineralogy and grain

1244
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,319
size are amenable to

1245
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,560
long relaxation times so they should

1246
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,640
record the field from when they formed

1247
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,880
her paleo intensity or grain size is in

1248
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,480
this nice psd like range which is ideal

1249
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,400
for paleo intensity

1250
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,079
they're highly thermal or her thermally

1251
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,359
stable and they're most likely holding a

1252
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,960
trm

1253
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,800
and so based on magnetic properties

1254
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,359
clinkers should be reliable full vector

1255
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,000
paleomagnetic recorders but we still

1256
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,599
needed

1257
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,359
or we still need to assess possible

1258
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,920
complexities such as cooling rate

1259
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,480
and anisotropy and so that is ongoing

1260
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,079
work

1261
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,400
that's occurring today we are running

1262
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,119
these experiments i can tell you

1263
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,880
um that they look really really good and

1264
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,680
so more work will be coming out on that

1265
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,440
soon

1266
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,440
so thank you and i will stop there

1267
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,800
wonderful thank you very much courtney

1268
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,560
um you can all show our

1269
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,920
round of applause with uh the zoom

1270
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,599
little applause button

1271
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,839
and that was really interesting um

1272
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,640
so i apologize for the background i i

1273
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,359
can open up

1274
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,760
uh the the floor to questions and i see

1275
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,680
uh

1276
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,240
andrew kosteroff you have your honda

1277
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,359
and if you'd like to on your microphone

1278
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,359
you can ask the question

1279
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:28,480
okay okay uh thank you courtney for uh

1280
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,880
for this very very interesting talk

1281
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,640
you mentioned the low temperature

1282
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,520
magnetometer as a method

1283
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:40,880
but it didn't show any pictures

1284
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,599
so so basically two questions concerning

1285
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,640
that

1286
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,599
have you ever seen very transition in

1287
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,480
any of your samples you did okay great

1288
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,920
yeah

1289
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,040
and uh did you compare

1290
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,079
okay yeah oh

1291
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,040
wow so so yeah

1292
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,599
i would say yeah so we we have some

1293
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,720
evidence of potentially

1294
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,760
yeah this last this last figure looks

1295
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,280
like a

1296
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:15,280
very but i i don't i don't agree

1297
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,520
with the left the left uh

1298
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,200
it's only to do with this no no no

1299
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,079
there's a separation it's probably not

1300
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,560
the fur way

1301
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,920
um but it's some sort of it's a traffic

1302
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,800
point we need to

1303
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,319
we need to discuss it but most important

1304
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,480
most important

1305
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:35,440
uh well from this data i i uh

1306
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,119
maybe you also have the data where you

1307
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,040
suspect this hc

1308
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:44,319
slt phase yeah so it's in

1309
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,359
these three samples okay but

1310
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,359
the problem is that

1311
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,920
you may know we started the the projects

1312
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,560
concerning the archaeomagnetic

1313
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,720
electromagnetic archaeological samples

1314
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,839
with colleagues from sofia

1315
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,520
recently and my

1316
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,880
my impression concerning this

1317
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,040
interpretation

1318
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,839
of hclps epsilon is

1319
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,599
we do have problems with this because

1320
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,160
synthetic epsilon

1321
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,359
iron oxide has a very distinctive low

1322
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,800
temperature properties

1323
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:23,760
and no nobody has it

1324
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,319
has ever seen that in either

1325
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,520
archaeological material

1326
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,359
or in your data so no i agree yep that

1327
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,400
is a problem with it

1328
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,040
and if i may one last

1329
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,000
uh short questions what is the range of

1330
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,760
curious temperatures of your hclt

1331
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,160
yes i was just going to mention that so

1332
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,720
our range of curie temperatures for that

1333
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,480
phase

1334
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,839
are it's not distinctly at 220 or 222

1335
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,680
which one would expect for

1336
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:57,119
pure uh the pure phase um it actually

1337
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,280
ranges from about 180 to 220

1338
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,000
and so it's possible like the

1339
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,839
conclusions of lopez sanchez that

1340
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,240
their phase had some titanium

1341
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,319
substitution

1342
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,359
the other issue is at least in

1343
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,040
laboratories

1344
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,440
the grain sizes that they were able to

1345
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,480
produce of this phase are very very very

1346
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,480
small and the grain sizes that are

1347
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,960
observed and archaeological materials

1348
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,720
are much

1349
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:26,000
larger and so if this

1350
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,480
is that phase um it suggests that maybe

1351
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,800
titanium substitution is making it

1352
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,160
not ideal but it could also be something

1353
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,319
else um

1354
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,560
but whatever we have is very similar to

1355
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,000
what's in the archaeological samples

1356
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,480
um forming from

1357
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,280
high temperature alteration yes yeah

1358
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,400
exactly

1359
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,599
okay and one more comment if if if greg

1360
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,839
would follow us in in our

1361
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,640
in our work with archaeological samples

1362
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,920
we have

1363
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,359
we had the unblocking temperatures down

1364
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,640
to 120

1365
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:04,079
for this phase so it's maybe even larger

1366
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,200
larger range yeah okay thank you very

1367
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,920
much courtney

1368
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,599
again thank you thank you thank you so

1369
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,160
we've got a couple of questions from

1370
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,200
the chat so gunther is wanting to know

1371
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,200
what is the

1372
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,359
highest uh temperature recorded in

1373
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,680
clinton deposits

1374
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,480
oh so the highest temperature recorded

1375
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,000
is around

1376
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,760
1500 degrees celsius um

1377
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,760
and so that's going to be within your

1378
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,400
chimney deposit so that's where you have

1379
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,240
hot gas that's being convected up

1380
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,839
there has been quite a bit of thermal

1381
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,920
modeling done on clinker

1382
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,040
deposits because or at least on coal

1383
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,520
seam fires

1384
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,040
because they are a a pretty big hazard

1385
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,119
because they raise a lot of gas

1386
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,640
and then b are a problem for people who

1387
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,559
want to mine coal

1388
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,640
and so they are monitoring these and so

1389
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,160
thermal models of basically temperature

1390
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,240
profiles at the surface

1391
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,400
do suggest that at the coal seam not

1392
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,079
necessarily within these chimneys

1393
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,040
you are still reaching temperatures of

1394
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,440
at least 800 degrees celsius if not

1395
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,440
higher

1396
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,880
i have another question um from uh

1397
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,800
quentin simon

1398
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,960
and he's wondering if you've already

1399
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,160
have some paleo intensity data

1400
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,440
uh and what would you say about that i i

1401
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,440
do um yeah so we've already collected

1402
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,119
some paleo intensity results

1403
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:26,319
and so this is them um

1404
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,880
and this is kind of my slide on that uh

1405
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:32,559
but yeah so we did thermal and microwave

1406
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,520
izzy experiments uh and a few dht shaw

1407
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,079
and basically what we're seeing is

1408
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,960
really

1409
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,559
nice straight arrived lots uh we're not

1410
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,599
observing a difference in some of our

1411
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,280
samples between

1412
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,680
the epsilon phase and the magnetite

1413
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,079
phase which one might observe

1414
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,839
because they have different cooling

1415
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,599
times

1416
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,680
so really consistent throughout also

1417
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,000
this is all from the same sample

1418
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,920
and so we're seeing really nice highly

1419
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,319
reproducible results

1420
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,800
within the same site and then

1421
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,400
these are consistent with univectorial

1422
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,040
decaying

1423
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,839
cider build plots um we do have some

1424
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,480
that are showing

1425
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,119
two different components and this could

1426
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,040
be

1427
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,359
because of grain size we don't really

1428
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,119
know the grain size of the epsilon phase

1429
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,640
but it could also be actually recording

1430
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,880
differences in the magnetic field during

1431
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,000
this time period and so this is kind of

1432
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,839
also a direction of future work good

1433
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
question

1434
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,240
thanks very much and we have time for

1435
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,480
one more quick question if anybody has

1436
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,480
one

1437
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,160
so i will i will throw it either to you

1438
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,079
you flash past your

1439
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,440
map uh showing the distribution of

1440
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,160
klingon

1441
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,240
and i mean at first glance it does kind

1442
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,040
of look as though there's a bit of a

1443
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,559
latitudinal band across north america

1444
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,280
and europe

1445
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,280
is that due to the distribution of the

1446
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,040
clinkers or just the distribution

1447
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:05,440
of clinkers that have been reported

1448
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,440
uh let me go to that map

1449
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,960
i should have gone the other direction

1450
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,040
so i believe it has to do with the

1451
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,000
distribution of clinkers that have been

1452
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,040
studied

1453
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
um so if you actually look at

1454
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,240
the distribution of coal seam fires uh

1455
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,359
it's a bit more spread out

1456
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,680
there we go um so yeah so distribution

1457
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:31,200
of coal seam fires

1458
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:34,400
tends to be a little bit more broad um

1459
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,559
where all the clinker deposits that are

1460
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,240
on this map are ones that have been

1461
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,240
studied

1462
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,760
it's likely they exist everywhere their

1463
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,720
coal seam fires

1464
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,680
um and people just haven't studied them

1465
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,359
uh because we know

1466
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,880
these processes if there's been a coal

1467
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,040
seam there have been occurring for at

1468
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,960
least thousands of years

1469
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,200
so i think this yeah this broad

1470
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,640
latitudinal band is probably just where

1471
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,920
people have studied

1472
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,720
also my bad um like

1473
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,160
movement of points onto a map might be

1474
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,800
part of it as well

1475
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:11,040
so plotting of data problems

1476
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,720
well thank you very much courtney um so

1477
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,000
i think at that point we'll

1478
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,920
we'll wrap it up and i want to thank

1479
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,520
courtney again for giving uh

1480
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,200
a really good presentation and

1481
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,760
discussing something that not a lot of

1482
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,359
people know

1483
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,800
a lot about so thank you very much

1484
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,800
courtney thank you

1485
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,760
oh you could all see me opening that oh

1486
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,760
well

1487
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,119
um before we all uh finish up i just

1488
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,160
want to

1489
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:42,480
make a couple of quick uh

1490
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:44,160
mentions um before we move on the um

1491
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,400
presentations are now being recorded and

1492
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,520
we're making them available online

1493
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,760
and through the magic

1494
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,200
youtube channel and that's a link there

1495
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,240
it's a very cumbersome and lovely

1496
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,520
looking thing

1497
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,240
but if you um just search

1498
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,040
for a magic consortium um you'll be able

1499
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,839
to find it

1500
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,800
so i want to thank earthref and the

1501
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,240
magic team

1502
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,359
for supporting that um the videos are

1503
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,119
actually going to be uploaded

1504
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:16,160

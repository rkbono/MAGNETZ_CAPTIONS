1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
right into it and we'll actually start

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,560
on home ground here in saint andrews and

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,240
we'll start with

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,120
tobias matson and he'll be

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,679
discussing decrypting magnetic fabrics

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,559
ams

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,880
arm a irm through the analysis of

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,400
mineral-shaped fabrics and distribution

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,600
and isotropy

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,600
so when you're ready to voice

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,399
so yeah can you see my screen yep

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,040
okay so i'm tobias and i'm a post doctor

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
researcher at the university of saint

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,680
andrews

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,360
but i'm also affiliated to stockholm

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,520
university in sweden so

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,840
i'm a visiting scholars in dangerous for

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
two years

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,440
okay so i'm going to talk about

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,199
the source of ams fabrics

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,680
in rocks and in particular igneous rocks

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,840
and igneous rocks usually the main

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,280
magnetic carrier is

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,560
titanium magnetite or magnetite and then

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
you have essentially two types of

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,240
fabrics

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
petrol fabrics that might contribute to

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
the ams fabric and that's the shape and

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,880
isotropic

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
which is basically that the ams

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,600
ellipsoid is controlled by the

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
the axis of the magnetite and for

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,040
example if you have multi-domain

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,520
magnetite

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
uh the long axis of the magnetite

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,360
crystal will correspond to the k1

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,119
the longest axis of the ams ellipsoid

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,600
or you can have a distribution and

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,560
stupid controlling the ams and

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,119
this is due to the magnetic interaction

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,680
between

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,880
for example magnetite and ferromagnetic

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,119
fiery magnetic

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,079
faces and i have an example here so for

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
example we have a

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,280
distribution which is like this in the

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
magnetite

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
and this would correspond to a k one

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,840
axis in the

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,840
ams ellipsoid point in this orientation

51
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:18,640
however studies on natural rocks

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,640
natural igneous rocks have

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,720
seen very minor or no relation between

54
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,959
distribution and institute and

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,000
ams and they have argued

56
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,840
over the last 20 years that distribution

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
and entropay is not a significant

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,239
process

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
generating the ems fabrics in igneous

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
rocks

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
however these studies have been on rocks

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,519
which

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,400
have uh have where the magnetized

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,160
crystals are

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
occurring as free-floating crystals and

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
they are quite far separated from each

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
other

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,560
so they haven't studied rocks where

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400
magnetic crystals are

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
closely clustered to each other and

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
therefore you can argue that they

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,120
haven't really

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
looked at the right sample to see if

74
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
distribution in isotropy can be a

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,560
significant factor controlling the ams

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,480
overall

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
so the the question really that they

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,920
want to answer with this

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,040
study is can distribution and

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,080
instruction

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,840
significantly affect the ams mark

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,080
and to study this i've chosen samples

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,599
which is a trachea endocyte and it's a

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,879
porphyrite trachea and design so it

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,720
contains

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,000
larger crystals which you call

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,159
phenocryst

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,720
or uh amphibole and also

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
uh one volume percent of this rock is

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,640
magnetized phenocryst

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
and fifty percent of the magnetite

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,599
phenocryst

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,440
in this rock occur in clusters so they

94
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,360
our potential here in this rock to see

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,080
if uh distribution

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,640
anisotropy can be significant in the ems

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,640
of this rock

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,400
so um we choose because um

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
analyzing distribution and histography

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
and shape fabrics can be

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
quite time consuming because you need to

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
scan them with

103
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
a ct or x-ray tomography

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,040
and the separation method takes quite

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,600
long so we only choose five samples from

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,880
five samples five sub-specimens from

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
five samples so it's

108
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,199
not a huge date uh sample set but

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
there's a huge amount of data that we

110
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,280
get out of this

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880
uh and these samples were analyzed for

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,000
ams

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,360
a irm so an isotropic isothermal remnant

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,960
finalization and

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
an isotope of anesthetic ground of

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,280
magnetization

117
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,240
and i used a 15 position orientation

118
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,639
scheme

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,919
with uh alternating field of 100 melee

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,199
tesla and a dc field of 50 micro tesla

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,160
and for the irm i used also 15 position

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:57,360
orientation schemes so the hex positions

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:00,639
uh with single diesels of 20 milli tesla

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,160
and i also scan these samples and due to

125
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,199
the contrast between the

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,479
these phases in the rock i could pick

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,560
out

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,560
the magnetite and amphibole shape and

129
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,199
distribution fabrics

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
using the x-ray ct scan and here you

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
have a

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,039
image of the x-ray city

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,520
and i guess when i scan these rocks or

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,520
the samples

135
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,639
i got 16 micrometer resolution

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,960
meaning that i can't see the smallest

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,160
magnetic faces in these rocks i probably

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,680
can't see

139
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,680
a single main magnetite

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,960
we used i separated the crystals

141
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,199
from the scans using the software blob

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,400
3d

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,600
and i should set a lower limit of 500

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,360
boxes

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
which basically means it's the volume of

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
the pixel

147
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,120
times 500 as the minimum

148
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,319
limit for magnetite is it to limit

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,120
processing time

150
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
and remove also some some noise and for

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
amphiboles at

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,400
a minimum limit for them at house a

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,400
thousand boxes

154
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,280
okay so um

155
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,400
to analyze uh the data that i got cut

156
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,720
out from the

157
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,240
the x-ray tomographies of the x-ray

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,360
scans

159
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,720
i used the software called tomafab which

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,360
was developed by my co-workers

161
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,960
and with this software you can calculate

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
length weighted crystal axis

163
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,120
eigenvectors

164
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
which basically generates a ellipsoid

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
with the

166
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,919
opposing axes that you can directly

167
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,400
compare with the ams

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:53,840
and remnants fabrics

169
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,160
and then for this paper or this study

170
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,800
i've been with them and developing an

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,599
another feature of tomofob

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,440
uh where we basically insert that you

173
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,840
can analyze distribution fabric in this

174
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,080
software

175
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
and then we used the definition by

176
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,800
stevenson

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,840
1994 which basically decides

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
the strength of interaction so

179
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,520
this is the weighting factor for the

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
distribution and histogram so we have

181
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
the omegas which is the volume of the

182
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,560
two grains

183
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
and then we have the distance between

184
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,440
the two grains

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
and this basically says that crystals

186
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
that are

187
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,759
larger volume and closer to each other

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
uh

189
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,800
gives a higher weight to the

190
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,840
distribution and isotropy

191
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
and this is also then presented as an

192
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,199
ellipsoid

193
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
with three opposing axes which you can

194
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,160
directly compare

195
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
with the ams fabric

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
so first we look at the shape of the

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,120
magnetic crystals so here i have a

198
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,160
backscattered electron image

199
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,720
of magnetite

200
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,199
and you can see that this is how they

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,680
commonly look in the rocks so we have

202
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
magnetic crystals occurring in clusters

203
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,800
if we separate them

204
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,160
they have these nice cubic shapes

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,759
and yeah cubic equine shapes uh

206
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
but with some degree of shape and

207
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,120
isotropy anyway so i mean this

208
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
this there's a difference between the

209
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,720
longest and shortest axis

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,800
um most of the crystals that we

211
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,800
separated or in the size range of

212
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,919
0.2 to 0.4 uh

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,760
millimeter long axis so this is the

214
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,959
and yeah most of the volume of the

215
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,039
crystal to be separated

216
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:46,480
occur in this size range

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,480
amphibole is prolate cigar shape

218
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,760
so you can see an image of a separated

219
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
amphibole

220
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,880
here's a backscattered electron image of

221
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,640
the amphibole and

222
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,920
you can see at the rims of the amphibole

223
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,000
you have these kind of

224
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,920
white speckles and that's actually a

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,720
breakdown ring in the amphibole

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,360
which contain magnetite you can also see

227
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,279
there's some

228
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
inclusions of magnetite in the alphabet

229
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,160
so this probably affect the magnetic

230
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,160
fabric of the amphiboles

231
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,200
yes here is the ams data from the whole

232
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,040
sample set so the small black arrows

233
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,519
point out the samples that were later

234
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,440
analyzed with the micro city

235
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,800
but what i essentially want to show you

236
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,240
is that

237
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,160
the data set or the samples are

238
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,920
represented for the whole or the

239
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,640
subspecial tissues are represented for

240
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,720
the whole sample so they're not outliers

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,560
to represent the fabric of the whole of

242
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
the whole rock

243
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,320
i also have a temperature accessibility

244
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
experiment

245
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
showing that the curves are not

246
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,959
reproducible between heating and cooling

247
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,560
uh but we also see a distinct drop at

248
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,480
around

249
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,000
570 580

250
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,240
degree centi centigrade indicating that

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,160
magnetite this or detainer magnetite is

252
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,440
the main magnetic carrier

253
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,000
but we also have uh probably magnemite

254
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,600
which which basically results in that

255
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,959
the curve is not reproducible between

256
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,839
heating

257
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,839
heating cooling

258
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
so now i will go through the data from

259
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,079
each

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,120
each of these samples so i will start

261
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,120
with

262
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,760
the shape fabric here which i have

263
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,959
plotted in lower hemisphere

264
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,399
equal area schmidt nets so first

265
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,160
start with mankind so this is the long

266
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,640
axis and you can see the long axis

267
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,680
plot in east west girdle distribution

268
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,160
which is then corresponding to that we

269
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,120
have the

270
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,920
maximum axis of the magnetite here and

271
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
the

272
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,279
intermediate axis here and the minimum

273
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,680
here amphibole

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,680
plots in a cluster

275
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,320
on the distance on the eastern side of

276
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,680
the stereo net

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,880
and we have a maximum of shape fabric

278
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,680
available here

279
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,200
and intermediate here if you compare

280
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,240
this with the

281
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,959
magnetic fabrics ams a irm and

282
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:25,040
a ir a rm we can see that

283
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,600
the maximum is located in the eastern

284
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
hemisphere and the intermediate in this

285
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
uh

286
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,640
it's already sub like sub horizontal in

287
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,640
the south

288
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,720
um and this basically shows that

289
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
the mass here is uh not really

290
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,399
controlled by the shape

291
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,760
completely controlled by the shape of

292
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
magnetite

293
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,959
but rather the the shape of the

294
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,360
amphibole crystals but also

295
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,720
the magnetic distribution and histogram

296
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
of magnetite

297
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,959
because you can see here we have the

298
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,959
dark gray symbols with uh

299
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,399
dashed outline which except essentially

300
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,680
shows the distribution and historical

301
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,600
the sample and it is

302
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,279
basically coaxial with the magnetic

303
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,120
fabrics in cb50

304
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,800
cb19 which is another sample we have

305
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
here's a little bit more complex we have

306
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
a east-west

307
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,720
girded distribution in nine tight long

308
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,519
axis so the shape fabric

309
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,680
we have a more of a cluster in the

310
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,040
southern hemisphere

311
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,040
for the amphibole shape fabric

312
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,800
while the magnetic fabrics plots in the

313
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,839
northern hemisphere

314
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,440
so they seem to be inverse to the shape

315
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,880
fabrics but also the distribution fabric

316
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,560
in magnetite

317
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,320
which is shown by these symbols with

318
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,880
test outlines here

319
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,480
so here the magnetic fabrics are inverse

320
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,959
relative to the shape and distribution

321
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
fabrics

322
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,920
in cb46 we have a

323
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,639
east and the western girdle distribution

324
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,519
in magnetite shallow smooth dipping we

325
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
have a

326
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,079
multi-modal dipping skirt distribution

327
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,279
for amphibole

328
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,480
here why the magnetic fabrics are

329
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:20,000
steeply dipping north-south

330
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,720
girdle distribution and if we look

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
at the different petrol fabrics so the

332
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,839
shape

333
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,639
fabric of magnetic and amphibole but

334
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,200
also the

335
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,959
distribution fabric of magnetite you can

336
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,800
see that

337
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,639
clearly the distribution fabric is the

338
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,160
most stupid thing so here the magnetic

339
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,399
fabric seems to correlate

340
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,600
mostly to the distribution fabric of

341
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,440
the magnetite in cb

342
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,920
55 we have a strong girdle distribution

343
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,959
northwest southeast current distribution

344
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,920
in magnetite

345
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,560
and in amphibole we can also see this

346
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,240
strong

347
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,839
distribution in the magnetic fabrics

348
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,320
but also in all three petal fabrics so

349
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:09,440
the amphibole and magnetized shape

350
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,440
and the magnetic distribution fabric

351
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,600
in cb61 we have a

352
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,199
strong northwest

353
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,880
southeast current distribution in the

354
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,000
maintenance shape

355
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,680
while the amphibole shape

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,440
and magnetic distribution have a

357
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,120
east-west moderately

358
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,880
southward different kernel distribution

359
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,120
and essentially demand the fabrics are

360
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,320
oriented intermediate in between the

361
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,639
magnetized shape

362
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,399
and the amphibole shape and magnetic

363
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,320
distribution fabric

364
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,839
so it seems that we have a magnetic

365
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,839
fabrics being a mix of the two

366
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,800
so if we compare these two three or four

367
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,320
and put them into and show the fabric

368
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,480
parameters so the t

369
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,440
fabric shape parameter which shows the

370
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,079
shape

371
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
so one is an old blade fabric so pancake

372
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,560
type fabric

373
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,720
and minus one is a prolly so cigar shape

374
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,320
fabric and we can see here that

375
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,639
the mass fabric is prolate

376
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,519
while the magnetic petrol fabrics of the

377
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,800
distribution fabric and shape fabric are

378
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,839
old bait and the amphibole shape fabric

379
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,000
is

380
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,959
prolate uh so this is something causing

381
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,120
the

382
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,639
the the ams fabric to become prolate

383
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,560
and if this might be that we have an

384
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,000
intersection between

385
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,680
uh delineation fabrics or the

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,920
magnetite distribution and the magnetic

387
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,920
shape at this point

388
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,920
causing it to become a prolific fabric

389
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,040
um yeah the similar is similar in

390
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,759
cb46 we have a strong old blade fabric

391
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,199
in the magnetite shape and magnetic

392
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
distribution

393
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,880
while the magnetic fabric has a little

394
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,399
bit of a weaker

395
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,600
oblate fabric which might be due to the

396
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,480
amphibole

397
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,120
or it's maybe due to an intersection

398
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,320
basically causing uh

399
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,040
maybe that these fabrics are interfering

400
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
with each other

401
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,800
basically lowering the degree of an

402
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
isotropy and the shape

403
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,839
of the fabric

404
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,639
in cb55 where everything seems to

405
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,440
coincide being coaxial

406
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,199
then we have quite a good correspondence

407
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,519
between

408
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,320
between the mass fabric and the shape

409
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,959
fabric

410
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,839
here of magnetite why we have a little

411
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,600
bit lower

412
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
distribution fabric which we can't

413
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,079
really explain

414
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:51,120
and then in cb 61 we have a

415
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,120
quite strong uh oblate

416
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,519
fabric for all the magnetic fabrics

417
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,720
while the three petrol fabrics have a

418
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,759
little bit

419
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,600
uh less strong oblate shape

420
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,120
and this it might be due to this kind of

421
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,959
mixed fabric

422
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
interacting each other and making the

423
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,439
monetary fabric

424
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,559
a little bit stronger if you look at

425
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,959
cb19 we

426
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,959
have the inverse fabrics

427
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,199
relative to the to the magnetite shape

428
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
and anti-bullshit

429
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,199
and the mindset distribution and

430
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
isotropy

431
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,360
it might be that these petrol fabrics

432
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
are basically interfering with each

433
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,000
other

434
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,200
which lowers the anisotropy of

435
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,840
uh the rock or the sample

436
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,919
and makes some for example a single

437
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,400
domain magnetite more domain than

438
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
and controlling the ams fabric so to

439
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,400
look at the single domain

440
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,799
contribution or higher cursivity

441
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,799
phases distribute contribution to the ms

442
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,400
fabrics i did

443
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:04,960
a partial arm using a

444
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,799
a different af alternating field range

445
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,799
and we can see then that

446
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:17,440
k2 or the r1 or the k k1 and k2

447
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:21,679
of the the aarm are oriented in this

448
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,039
uh north west south east

449
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,640
girdle essentially showing that

450
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,480
the high coercivity grains have a

451
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,000
preferably orientation in the in the

452
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,400
north in northwestern hemisphere

453
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,039
or the northeast and western hemisphere

454
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,840
and this might contribute to

455
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,840
to to the inversion of the fabric

456
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,000
i'm there twice yep yes so

457
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,200
you have to summarize we have the three

458
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,240
components of the petrol fabric

459
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,240
that contribute to the petrol fabric and

460
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,160
they either interfere constructively

461
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,400
making the fabric stronger so they have

462
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,559
a stronger

463
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,080
degree of anisotropy or destructively

464
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,160
and making the fabric

465
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,280
weaker and this generates the

466
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,840
ams fabric but what's also interesting

467
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,640
is it's that the distribution is

468
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,000
anisotropic also seems to affect the

469
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,799
uh an anisotropy of damage magnetization

470
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,400
so uh essentially the spatial

471
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,840
distribution magnetite also seems to

472
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
have some effect on the spatial

473
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,840
distribution

474
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:36,320
or on the uh the ram magnetization which

475
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:41,200
i think so far has not really been shown

476
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,200
yeah so thank you for me

477
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:56,559
so uh do we have any questions

478
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,559
uh yeah can i ask a question

479
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,240
uh yeah very nice talk can i can i think

480
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,200
about how you

481
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
calculate the distribution anatomy from

482
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,640
your

483
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,919
tomography data i saw at one point you

484
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
showed an equation

485
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
yeah that sort of that quantified the

486
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,039
the the da

487
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:23,360
and it's a function primarily

488
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,360
just the distance between particles

489
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,200
but do you not want to take into account

490
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,320
or in a in a spherical

491
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,760
cluster or whatever i mean how how do

492
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
you actually

493
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,280
do that yes i i only heard like half of

494
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,799
your question

495
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,960
because you cut off okay sorry

496
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,320
it's about how you calculate the the

497
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,400
distribution anisotropy from there

498
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,159
from the tomography uh because it seemed

499
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,240
that the equation you showed

500
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,320
was just a function of distance but but

501
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
surely the the spatial

502
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,679
arrangement also comes into it in some

503
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,840
way

504
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,720
yeah so uh this this equation is the

505
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
it's the the main one that people have

506
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
used

507
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,200
just to calculate distribution and

508
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,200
entropy so it's basically you choose the

509
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,960
uh descent the point descent point

510
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,559
between crystal

511
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,159
you take all the crystals that you have

512
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,559
in your data set

513
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,760
but then you weigh them depending on the

514
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,159
the distance between them

515
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,120
and the volume of the because each

516
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
crystal

517
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,360
there have been a new uh a new equation

518
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
just published i think

519
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,480
a couple of weeks ago by andrea

520
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,600
biedemann

521
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,600
and we haven't really looked into this

522
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,919
but this is the this is the main

523
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,640
definition that people have used

524
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,679
but i i agree that there might be some

525
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,240
some other kind of

526
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,840
a spatial thing that you we need to

527
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,840
consider as well

528
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,720
okay do we have any other questions

529
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,320
uh yeah well let's also just echo what

530
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,679
rich said it was really nice talk

531
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,960
um i was uh curious

532
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,520
why did microc ct because the resolution

533
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,640
is quite

534
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,440
coarse is 16 micro tests

535
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
sorry 16 microns um i was just wondering

536
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,320
if you thought about trying ebsd

537
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,080
obviously that's not three-dimensional

538
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,679
to me two-dimensional but then you can

539
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,720
you can map out automatically quite

540
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,840
large areas at a much higher resolution

541
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,440
yeah right so when we started this study

542
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,159
we basically wanted to

543
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,280
have the same sub-specimen and that we

544
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,480
did the ams on

545
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,039
and run it completely to the the ct

546
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,159
scanner

547
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,960
so we basically have a we get the 3d

548
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,840
resolution exactly from the same core as

549
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,320
we did ams

550
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,280
and uh yeah so we wanted to start with

551
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,600
this but

552
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
i definitely want to look further in the

553
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,760
future maybe

554
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
cutting up these cores and and and and

555
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,799
getting more

556
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,840
into detail with the single domain and

557
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
smaller crystals as well

558
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,159
okay i i had another question

559
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,400
many years ago when williams and i

560
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,400
published a paper on

561
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,080
distribution anazotropy and we did a

562
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,840
micromagnetic approach and to

563
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
to get it to work we couldn't model

564
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,360
alternating fields so we did

565
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,480
an asexual of srm yeah in a distribution

566
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,679
looking interacting particles and mike

567
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,720
jackson said that

568
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,919
an isotropy of uh high field signals you

569
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600
can't really resolve

570
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,440
properly something to do with

571
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,320
calculating the eigenvectors and i never

572
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,760
really understood

573
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,440
what he meant and i could never find a

574
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,400
reference to what he said maybe i should

575
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,799
have just asked him

576
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,440
i mean i was just wondering are we so

577
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,120
you're doing this anadropy of irm i mean

578
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,520
some of the results are really sometimes

579
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,010
really quite different to the anazotropy

580
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,000
of arm or or the ams i mean

581
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,080
[Music]

582
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,840
do you have any thoughts on the on the

583
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,200
dangers of using anazotropy of irm

584
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,000
uh yeah i i mean not

585
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,039
not not really because the reason that i

586
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,840
did this was because

587
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,840
or anesthetic magnetizer broke

588
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,679
so i just tried try this and

589
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,240
but it seems like because i could i

590
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,120
could get this very low cursivity range

591
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,880
with this

592
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
right and i would presumably get a high

593
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,360
coercivity range with the

594
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,039
aarm so it seems like

595
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,279
if i it seems like that

596
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,400
the fabric is basically controlled by

597
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,200
this very low

598
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,559
the low cursive the crystal or crystal

599
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
grains

600
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,600
and this is basically what i think i got

601
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,600
out from the air

602
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:46,400
i don't have a better explanation or

603
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,400
answer okay right so

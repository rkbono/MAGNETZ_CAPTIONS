1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,720
next one who is which is from

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,160
craig martin on paleocene latitude

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,360
of the koshan lad arc arc

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,519
an initiate indicates multi-stage indian

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,119
eurasian collision

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,640
whether i pronounce that all right i

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,439
have no idea but i'm

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,359
sure i'll find out all right let me just

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,160
share my screen

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,119
can you all hear me and see see my title

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
slide

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,600
yeah we can alright well i can

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,360
great that's that's enough for me no i

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
hope you can all see it um

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,440
so yeah i'm very excited to be here or

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
here in 2d today

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,920
to present to you um some of our

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
paleomagnetic results from the western

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,280
himalaya

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
which we believe indicate that the india

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,920
eurasia collision was actually a

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,320
multi-stage process

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,559
rather than a single stage continent

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,760
continent collision event

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
so before i start i'd like to

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
acknowledge that this is the work of of

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
myself and a number of co-authors i'm a

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,440
student um of professor oliver yagoots

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
at mit

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,320
and the work was supported by the nsf

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,080
and also some internal mit funding

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,320
um so the closure of oceans and

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,479
subsequent continental collisions are of

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,680
course a fundamental component of the

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,799
wilson cycle and and are

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,439
important in plate tectonics and

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,520
our most spectacular example to study

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,320
the processes involved with continental

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
collision

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,759
is of course the himalayan karakoram

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,720
tibet origin in in

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,920
south south asia and so i'm showing you

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,400
a map here of

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
um the sort of western half of the

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,360
himalaya it's it's a

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,320
kind of tectonic map um

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
and the closure of the near tethys ocean

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,920
which once separated

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,240
india and eurasia is now preserved along

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
the the narrow suture zones which

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,479
transect the himalayan belt they're

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
shown in thick black lines on this map

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,200
and so in the central and eastern

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,560
himalaya india and eurasia are separated

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,200
from each other um along just one suture

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,800
zone the sangpo sutures

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,640
and but in the western himalaya the

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
tectonic sort of arrangement is

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
different

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
so there india and eurasia are separated

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,319
from one another

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,520
and by the remnant of a jurassic to

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,440
cretaceous age

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,680
intraoceanic subduction system

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,840
which is now sandwiched between the

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,200
indian and eurasian continents

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,920
and so in the western himalaya

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,160
the intraocyanic terrain is separated

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,319
from india by the indus such a zone

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,599
and from eurasia by the shaykh such a

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
zone

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,120
so the timing of collision is well

73
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,680
constrained

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,720
on the northern indian margin to the

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,280
paleocene

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:57,280
between 55 and 60 ma

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,120
by the arrival of volcanic archdetritus

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,319
into indian margin sediments

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,760
and some other proxies but

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,319
the metamorphic response to collision in

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,040
in tibet is not really observed until

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
the the

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,920
the mid-ear scene so around 40 to 45

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,040
ma um and so

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,800
the age of the shaykh such a zone which

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,959
separates the cursed arc from eurasia

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,720
is still disputed so that has been

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,519
argued to be as young as 40 million

89
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
years old

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,599
to as many as old as over 80 million

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,799
years old

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,080
and so the differences in how we

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,640
interpret the ages

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
of of collision events and the ages of

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
these structures

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,319
has allowed two conflicting collision

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,959
models for the india eurasia collision

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,440
to persist

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,599
so in the in the standard model the

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,760
india eurasia collision is considered to

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,840
be a single stage continent continent

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,239
collision in which india moved rapidly

103
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,319
northwards across the near texas ocean

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,319
and impacted the southern margin of

105
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,200
eurasia in the paleocene

106
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,920
however plate reconstructions show that

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
there's

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,439
thousands of kilometers of separation

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,159
between india

110
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,159
and the eurasian continent at this time

111
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,720
and so accordingly it's been interpreted

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
that there has to have been a a large

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
extent of

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,280
india that's now that's now lost and

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
up to two up to an and above two

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,680
thousand kilometers of of

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,320
north south extra indian continent which

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
is

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,240
referred to as greater india

120
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
and so the alternative model that's been

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
suggested

122
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
is that in the near tethys ocean south

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,680
of eurasia

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
a and in the intraoceanic subduction

125
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
system

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
which is preserved in primarily in the

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,040
western himalaya

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,440
was active at a near equatorial latitude

129
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
um

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,639
until it collided with the northern

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
margin of india

132
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,600
in the paleo scene and then final

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,560
continental collision in this model

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
did not occur until 40 to 45 may after

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,800
the closure

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,600
of um of an ocean basin which which has

137
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,600
been called the shiroda ocean basin

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
so this this multi-stage collision model

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
is attractive

140
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
because it reconciles the separation

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,560
between the indian and eurasian

142
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,800
continents at the time

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,479
of collision with the amount of crustal

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,759
shortening that's been observed

145
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,320
in in the himalayan belt

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,919
and also the the activity of a second

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,400
subduction system which we're calling

148
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,960
the transtethian subduction zone

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,800
south of the eurasian margin throughout

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,600
the closure of the near tethys has been

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
argued as a as a potential explanation

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,919
for the rapid motion the anomalously

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,199
rapid motion of india

154
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,199
during the late cretaceous

155
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,160
so crucially each of these models makes

156
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,560
a distinctly different prediction

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,720
about the location of remnants of this

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,360
trans-tethine subduction zone

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,800
um in the late cretaceous and early

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
paleocene time

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
so the single-stage collision model

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
requires that this intraoceanic

163
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,319
subduction system had accreted onto the

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,960
southern margin of eurasia long before

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,080
the arrival of india whereas and so it

166
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,639
should be situated

167
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,479
at a paleo latitude of greater than 20

168
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,319
degrees north throughout late cretaceous

169
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,800
and paleocene time

170
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
whereas in the multi-stage collision

171
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,319
scenario

172
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,919
the intro oceanic subduction system

173
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
would be expected to be at a more

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
southerly paleolatitude

175
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
near the equator until it collided with

176
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
india

177
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,080
in in the paleocene

178
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,199
so we set out to to resolve between

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,360
these two

180
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,199
conflicting models by doing a

181
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,319
paleomagnetic study

182
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,759
of the cardin volcanics in in ladakh

183
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
in west india so the canon volcanics are

184
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,639
a suite

185
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,160
of rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are the

186
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
extrusive equivalent

187
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,880
of the coast and ladakh arc batholith

188
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,880
which is this intraoceanic

189
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,919
terrain in the western himalaya um

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,000
and so and we

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,759
studied the upper section of these of

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,800
these volcanics because

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
um the presence of ash horizons and and

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
sediments

195
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,840
interbedded with the the rhyolite

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,160
volcanics allowed us to

197
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,919
get a a good estimation of the paleo

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,680
horizontal so these rocks

199
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,840
are tilted towards the north and so

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,800
in the south the carbon volcanics are

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,560
bounded by

202
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,560
the plutonic rocks of the of the

203
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,400
batholith and then in the north they're

204
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,199
bounded by the structures of the shark

205
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
suture zone

206
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
so that's the the sort of structure that

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
separates the arc from the eurasian

208
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
margin

209
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,479
so we did some ex some precise uranium

210
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,759
lead zircon geochronology

211
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,240
um from throughout our sampled

212
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
section and we were able to constrain

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,039
the age of our

214
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,639
volcanic rocks to between 61.6

215
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,520
and 66.1 million years so this puts it

216
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
just before

217
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,560
the collision uh that just before

218
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,680
collision began to affect the

219
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,599
northern indian margin and actually the

220
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,240
age range overlaps with some of the

221
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,800
first

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,759
uh ophelite abductions onto the onto

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,120
india in

224
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:23,199
in pakistan so

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,840
the 44.5 ma age range is long enough

226
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,319
in theory to average the the secular

227
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,320
variation of the geodynamo

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,719
um and the the age of these rocks

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
is should help us resolve between the

230
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
two models because it constrains the

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,360
location or will help us constrain the

232
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,360
location

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,640
of the intraoceanic subduction system

234
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
shortly prior to

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,080
the india the collision initiation on

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,480
the indian margin

237
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,399
so for our paleomagnetic sampling you

238
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
i'm assuming most of you will be

239
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,800
quite familiar with this we sample 5 to

240
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,880
13 oriented calls drilled from

241
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
individual volcanic flows at each of our

242
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
sites

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,680
we demagnetize those samples using

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,839
alternating field and thermal

245
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,040
demagnetization techniques at the

246
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,720
mit paleomagnetism laboratory

247
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
and then we use principal component

248
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,880
analysis to isolate individual magnetic

249
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,959
components from our from our samples

250
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,360
and a combination of the unblocking

251
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,959
temperature and hysteresis experiments

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,279
shows that the the primary carrier of

253
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,040
magnetization in our samples is

254
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
single domain or pseudo single domain

255
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,720
magnetite which are good

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,959
paleomagnetic recorders and so

257
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
our results as you can see here define

258
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,839
two antipodal populations this is the

259
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
results in geographic and tilt corrected

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,360
coordinates we have

261
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:49,200
18 site mean orientations

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,360
and these antipodal populations when

263
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,600
plotted against stratigraphy

264
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,080
and resolve all but one of the expected

265
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,519
magnetocrons for the for the age range

266
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
of our study

267
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,279
and so the presence of these expected

268
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,399
magnetic reversals is a strong

269
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,519
indication

270
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,920
that the uh magnetization of our samples

271
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,959
is a

272
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,640
is not a post-depositional overprint

273
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,079
and because such an overprint would of

274
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,839
course be expected to

275
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,120
over to completely obliterate the

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,800
reserve the reversal record

277
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,760
and to further confirm that our results

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,360
are primary we conducted conglomerate

279
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,519
tests at the top and base

280
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,959
of our sample section so this is an

281
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,600
example from the

282
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,720
test at the top of the section uh on the

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,800
left here

284
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,839
and as you can see from the distribution

285
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
so in a

286
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
in a conglomerate test the you would

287
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,360
expect class magnetization directions

288
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,480
to be randomly distributed and because

289
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,279
that's how they should be

290
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,440
from from being transported and then

291
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,240
redeposited

292
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,320
and as you can see on the left our class

293
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,360
magnetization directions are indeed

294
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
randomly distributed and we confirm this

295
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,800
using a watson test for randomness which

296
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,880
which passes in all cases

297
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,920
so because we're confident that the

298
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,079
magnetic

299
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,320
the magnetization directions of our of

300
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,399
our samples are the primary

301
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,079
record from when the volcanic rocks

302
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,000
formed

303
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,839
we can use them to determine a

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
paleomagnetic pole for the cardinal

305
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,560
volcanics

306
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,040
and therefore the transtation subduction

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,560
zone shortly prior to the india eurasia

308
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,720
collision

309
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:34,640
and the uh uncertainty angle of uh um

310
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,040
of our paleomagnetic pole is within the

311
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,920
acceptable uh constraints of dean in a

312
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,800
tile 2011.

313
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,640
and so this pole allows us to constrain

314
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,399
the coast and ladakh arc

315
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
and and therefore the transtethian

316
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,800
subduction system

317
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,200
to a paleolatitude of 8.1 plus or minus

318
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,800
5.6 degrees north

319
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,079
in in the time range between 61.6

320
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,480
and 66.1 million years ago

321
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,240
this paleo attitude is is in our view

322
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
significant because it allows us to

323
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,240
construct to

324
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,240
choose between the two uh conflicting

325
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,519
collision models

326
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,360
our results are uniquely compatible

327
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
with a multi-stage collision model

328
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
because they place the inter

329
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,800
oceanic subduction system significantly

330
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,880
south of eurasia

331
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,279
at uh the in the at the cretaceous

332
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,279
palestine boundary

333
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,760
so that's our plate reconstruction

334
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,040
showing the coast and ladakh arc

335
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,480
um and it's positioned between uh

336
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,240
600 and 2300 kilometers south of the

337
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
contain

338
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,959
contemporaneous eurasian margin

339
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
and so the presence of this oceanic

340
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,920
plate

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,880
between india and eurasia after 50 to 55

342
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,399
ma

343
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,639
explains the explains the

344
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,880
difference between the amount of

345
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,760
convergence expected

346
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,600
in the in the india eurasia collision

347
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,880
and the amount of observed crustal

348
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,560
deformation

349
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,000
in the eurasian and indian margins

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,720
and our results also put a firm upper

351
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
boundary

352
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,320
on the maximum size of greater india to

353
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,760
less than

354
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:24,160
900 kilometers

355
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,959
so here are our results again presented

356
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
against the

357
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,240
um plate reconstructions from van

358
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,560
hensberg hotel

359
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,200
uh 2019 um and this black line

360
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,680
is the predicted paleo latitude of the

361
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,600
intraoceanic subduction system

362
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,399
using the double subduction model of

363
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,199
yaguza tile 2015 so this is modeling the

364
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,800
double a double subduction system

365
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,399
and as you can see our results are in

366
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
good agreement with that with that

367
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,720
prediction

368
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,880
and also a multi-stage collision model

369
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,199
is in good agreement with the available

370
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,440
plate reconstructions

371
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,959
so we believe that our debate our data

372
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,279
supports a multi-stage

373
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,240
india eurasia collision model in which

374
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,680
first

375
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,760
india sorry india collided with an intro

376
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,800
the inter-oceanic subduction system

377
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,880
at 50 to 60 ma and then continued to

378
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,279
move northward while the shiroda ocean

379
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,079
basin subducted beneath eurasia

380
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,639
before finally colliding with eurasia in

381
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,600
the continent continent collision at 40

382
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,399
to 45

383
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,360
ma that's 15 million years later than is

384
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,480
generally assumed

385
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,000
so this collision chronology

386
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
is well preserved in the western

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,480
himalaya where the indus suture zone

388
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,079
records the first stage of collision

389
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,240
between the intro oceanic

390
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,600
coast and ladakh arc and the northern

391
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,320
margin of india this

392
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,199
sushi zone is well constrained to 50 to

393
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,399
55 million years

394
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,160
so final india eurasia collision then

395
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,839
therefore occurred along the shaykh

396
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,240
sangpo sutra zone

397
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,519
not the indus sancpo such suture zone

398
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,720
and it's constrained

399
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:07,120
in the western himalayas to between 40

400
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,279
and 45 ma by the chemical changes in in

401
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,160
the ladakh batholith

402
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,360
so with that i will uh i'd like to thank

403
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,199
again my co-authors

404
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,240
and and and sponsors um i'd specifically

405
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,160
like to thank

406
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,839
my undergraduate field assistant jade

407
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,040
fisher who was incredibly

408
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,440
helpful in the field and and also my

409
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
hosts serwang dorje and stanzan kando

410
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,320
who

411
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,639
who graciously accommodated us in in

412
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,480
ladakh during our field season

413
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,560
so with that thank you i i'm happy to

414
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,320
take questions um and if you're more

415
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,920
interested in this work and don't get to

416
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,759
ask a question and though

417
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,079
it is published in the proceedings of

418
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,079
the national academy of sciences now so

419
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,240
you can find it there and i'm also happy

420
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,120
to answer any questions by email

421
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
so thanks very much

422
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,240
thank you very much craig so

423
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,040
has anyone got any questions that they'd

424
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
like to ask

425
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:12,399
yes i have some questions

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,399
uh did you consider uh

427
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,880
from anaya so if you look at repellent

428
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,510
network from

429
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,800
third schema it suggests

430
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:24,320
[Music]

431
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,680
it's already a part of the tetramena at

432
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,519
60 ma

433
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,399
so remaster clad before 6

434
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
mma so sorry which which which

435
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,600
measurement are you talking to you cut

436
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,000
out a little bit i i i i miss you

437
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
there are a lot of a lot of magnetic

438
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
data from

439
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,120
test human iron so they're highlighted

440
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
at 60 ml is either same are the data

441
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
from an

442
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
attack so that means they are already

443
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,839
together

444
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,880
you mean the the work from pakistan

445
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,320
no not from pakistan

446
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,400
from the tether similar sorry i'm i'm

447
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,199
sorry if i'm i'm misunderstanding okay

448
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,919
so

449
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,880
the the the data from the tethys

450
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,919
himalaya

451
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,439
is um well that's that's

452
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,600
sort of been interpreted to show that

453
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,160
india that greater india extended

454
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
hugely you know the the greater india

455
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,760
extension was large but

456
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,799
i'm not sure of any tethers himalaya

457
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,200
data that would

458
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,640
constrain the location of the of the

459
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,120
ladakh system

460
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,840
i would argue that our data is from you

461
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,840
know

462
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,840
from igneous rocks and for you know

463
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,440
i i see i you're right there is a there

464
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,840
is a problem in the in this

465
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,200
sort of field because we have some data

466
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,000
from the tethers himalaya which is

467
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
primarily

468
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,480
sedimentary originated paleomagnetic

469
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,520
data which puts

470
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,480
a large extent on greater india

471
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,160
whereas and our data conflicts with that

472
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,480
but i would argue that

473
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,480
um the a smaller extent of greater india

474
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
not only agrees better with the

475
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,960
paleomagnetic data particularly

476
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
particularly from from our study but it

477
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,240
also

478
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
matches the amount of under thrusting

479
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,559
beneath the

480
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,039
eurasias so the the seismic

481
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,039
imagery beneath tibet shows that the

482
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,840
indian continent is only subducted by

483
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,000
600

484
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,280
kilometers so i i think it's quite hard

485
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,960
to imagine

486
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,360
why um it's quite hard to see how you

487
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
lose

488
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
over a thousand kilometers of

489
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,960
continental crust

490
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,480
um in the in under thrusting so i think

491
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
it's it's important to now

492
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
look at that paleomagnetic data and ask

493
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,919
well why is it giving us

494
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,679
latitudes that are so far north it's

495
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,039
possible that those sediments formed

496
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,360
you know in association with this

497
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,559
intraoceanic system

498
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,559
at least that's what i would argue

499
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,559
and also i think the paleolithic you

500
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,320
used for nasa has some problem

501
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:03,200
because a lot of magnetic

502
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,880
data suggests resolving your asia your

503
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,280
lasso block is located at something

504
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,400
about

505
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,120
15 degrees not 30 degrees so

506
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,080
i mean so we compared it to the that

507
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,200
means

508
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
the starting ratio is my

509
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,440
you're right so you're right if if you

510
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,840
raise your sorry you've got a set

511
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,600
then then it it makes it harder to

512
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
distinguish the cursed in ladakh arc

513
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
from eurasia so

514
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
we're comparing our results to the play

515
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,960
reconstruction of van hinsberg and hotel

516
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,320
which incorporates much of the most

517
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
reliable

518
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,360
as far as unaware all of the reliable

519
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,320
paleomagnetic data

520
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,840
from from tibet so that that from lasso

521
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,720
particularly so so that's the

522
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,080
that's the uh that's the latitude that

523
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
we're comparing our data to

524
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
okay thank you very much for the

525
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
question there's another one from

526
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
connell in the chat who said how do you

527
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,080
decide

528
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,840
the hemisphere it also it's also

529
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,600
consistent with greater india

530
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,919
with large rotations dot dot dot

531
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,520
yeah that's that's referring to the the

532
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,039
um

533
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,960
the the are you referring to the the

534
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,600
data from the tethers himalayan or the

535
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,360
or the data i just presented

536
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,840
i have no idea so we know that so we

537
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
we

538
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,520
are another hemisphere because um of the

539
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,000
inclination direction right and

540
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
these rocks have not been rotated 180

541
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,840
degrees from

542
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
from their original orientation

543
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,640
i i guess my question how do you know

544
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
that

545
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,240
how do we so well i i mean the

546
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,919
because they form aren't you know that

547
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
they're still the right way up right and

548
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,799
if you

549
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,320
have twisted them around completely like

550
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,480
there just isn't structural

551
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,960
support for that in in the in the field

552
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,440
you know you can follow this unit across

553
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,039
tens of kilometers of the region we work

554
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,120
in in northwest india

555
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,120
and it you know to to rotate the whole

556
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,880
carbon volcanics by that much would

557
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,120
would be

558
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:17,280
you know it doesn't make sense in in the

559
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,280
field i would argue

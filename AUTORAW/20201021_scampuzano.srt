1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,760
okay thank you everyone to um come to

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,799
the

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,160
magnet uh seminar uh

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,799
today is gonna be um it's gonna be

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,400
um by saya arquero campunzano

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,480
she's going to present the evolution of

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,439
the germany field for the last three

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
millennia

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,760
from the iron age and shock 2k

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
reconstructions

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,039
from valentine iron age and south

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,160
atlantic anomalies

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,360
sayo is she's based in madrid

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,280
as a seminal format as usual we have 25

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,480
minutes presentation

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,079
um then we will have about 10 15 minutes

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,719
for question discussion we're always

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,600
flexible

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,039
you can always write your questions in

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
the textbook

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,480
uh it's an informal environment so if

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,000
you want to go

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,160
don't worry about it you can go the

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,079
seminar recorded and there'd be some

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
time at the end of the seminar to catch

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
up

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,199
this will not be recorded so for now i

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,359
would like to

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:13,840
give sayoah the the ball

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:17,119
start the presentation okay

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,119
okay did you see my screen yes thank you

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,520
okay and the pointer yes perfect

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
okay

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,920
so thank you very much uh hi everybody

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
and thank you for this opportunity to

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,360
present our work

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
about the emergence and evolution of the

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
geomagnetic field for the last three

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,159
millennia

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,079
and the this this work is about

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
emergence and evolution of two uh

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,680
magnetic anomalies

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,119
the eleventh in iron age anomaly and the

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
south atlantic anomaly

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
from global reconstruction of the

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
paleomagnetic field

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,799
this work has been developed for the by

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
the group of palu magnetism of the

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
completeness university of madrid and

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,799
i'm going to present the main results

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,759
so first we have to know

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,239
who our principal actresses are the

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,440
levantine iron age anomaly is a large

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
positive anomaly

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,520
related to very high values and fast

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,560
variation of the humanities field

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
intensity

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,200
at the earth surface between 1000 bc and

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,080
700 bc

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,000
in the levantine region according to

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,560
2016. in the

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,599
in 2017 sar ital observed

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,120
prominent high virtual actual moment

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,120
values in the chain frame of the

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
levantine ironate anomaly

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,480
in orange in these figures not only in

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,040
the 11th region but also in caucasus and

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
for many times but much lower values in

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,680
greece

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:55,040
and bulgaria in the period between

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,920
500 bc and 200 bc

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,760
in green in the figure we also serve as

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,800
a compiled intensity height

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,640
you know in all regions and

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,959
related in this case with a fast

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,159
circular variation in europe

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,280
so um so and at

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,280
the continental scale regarding the

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,879
first height that is to say the eleventh

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,319
in iron age anomaly

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,720
they conclude that a non-vital feature

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,080
is required to explain the pile

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,000
intensity difference

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,400
in the interval between 1000 bc and 700

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,239
bc between kaukasu levant

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,640
and the balkans also in this year

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,440
in 2017 davis and constable

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,840
proposed a spike model to explain these

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,519
high values at their surface

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,040
in a very quick way they insert a spike

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
into the radial component of the

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,480
geomagnetic field at the cormenter

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,159
laundry here in the a

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,760
figure in the 11th region and in

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,799
the texas region and in this spikes

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,159
modeled like

97
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,280
um fisherman misses probability

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,200
distribution

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,040
and they model the geomagnetic field

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
with these characteristics

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,400
the model shows that instantaneous

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,759
surface expression this is intensity

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,919
at their surface the model shows that

104
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,880
the instantaneous surface expression of

105
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,320
high

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,280
intensities must extend over abroad

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,320
geographical area estimated to be around

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,840
60 degrees of longitude they also

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,800
suggest that the levantine

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,759
magnetic spike reflects an intense and

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
localized

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
neuroequatorial flux patch on the

113
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,240
current

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,919
boundary emerged from within the core

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,639
and subsequently the cage

116
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,199
in the same place or grew in the

117
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,960
equatorial region and migrated northward

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,520
and westward for that part

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,800
of the for your part the south atlantic

120
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,880
anomalies are region with

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
low values of geomagnetic field

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
intensity

123
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,720
at the air surface it covers the most

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,600
part of south america

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
south atlantic ocean and south africa

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
its internal

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
origin is associated with the presence

128
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,479
of reversal flux

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,360
patches at the cormental boundary from

130
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:22,840
1840 but they could be older

131
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,120
here we can see the intensity at the

132
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,440
earth at their surface

133
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
and the radial component of the radial

134
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,320
of

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
the magnetic field at the core mental

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,800
boundary

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,160
in january 2020 from cow's model

138
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,960
so from a model derivative by

139
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,800
satellite data and instrumental data the

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,919
white line control

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,039
gives an idea about the aerial extent of

142
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
the south atlantic

143
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,199
anomaly at the present days and with the

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,880
black square

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
we see the two reversal flux patches

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,960
here and

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
here located beneath seoul america and

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,800
south africa

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,880
commonly associated with this or

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,680
internal origin of the south atlantic

151
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,039
anomaly

152
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,280
in detail we can see this movie uh

153
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,160
with the evolution of the intensity at

154
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,479
the air

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,560
on the its surface and the radial

156
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,280
component of the geomagnetic field at

157
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:27,039
the cormanter boundary from 1600

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,280
a.d until our days

159
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,759
the present days and we can see very

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,360
well the relationship between

161
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,000
this anomaly their surface and this

162
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
reveals

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
reversal flux patches at the core mantle

164
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,600
boundary

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,039
but the question here is what is the

166
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,759
real age of this

167
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
reversal flux patches and in tour of the

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,520
south atlantic anomaly

169
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,360
in the few last in the few years in the

170
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,199
in the last few years sorry several

171
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,720
works point out that

172
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,199
they could be older than we thought

173
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
um in this presentation i'm going to

174
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,960
talk about the results provided by our

175
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,759
group the last year

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,520
which proposed this is a spoiler that

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,479
the reversal flux patches

178
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:19,520
cause emerge around 950 a.d

179
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,240
so to understand better uh

180
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,319
the nature of these anomalies the the

181
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
live element in ionic anomaly and the

182
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,440
south atlantic anomaly

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,160
we must start from palu magnetic data

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,759
we can see here this partial and

185
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
temporal distribution of the

186
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
archmagnetic and volcanic database

187
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,840
coming from

188
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,319
your media 50 the last version for the

189
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,039
last

190
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,960
3 000 years and we see for example in

191
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,720
the time distribution

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,800
panel shows uh this panel shows a

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
decrease in the number of declination

194
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,319
and inclination

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,280
values during the first millennia before

196
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,879
chris and not so important in the case

197
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
of the intensity and in

198
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,879
space we can't see very well that the

199
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,879
data are greatly

200
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:12,080
concentrated in the northern hemisphere

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,479
but there is an incorporation of

202
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,410
intensities from africa and from south

203
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,680
america

204
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,440
[Music]

205
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,879
improves the spatial coverage in the

206
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
southern hemisphere

207
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,960
inhibition new data coming from the

208
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,759
ivarian peninsula prior to late ironic

209
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,720
times an epoch very poorly constrained

210
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,479
up to date

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
and very interesting because the

212
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,479
levantine iron 8

213
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,760
anomaly times have been also

214
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,399
incorporated in this database

215
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,080
from this figure we can also see another

216
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,800
effect the effect of

217
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,760
applying quality criteria on the data

218
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,320
light colors

219
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,120
represents quality data and dark colors

220
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
represent

221
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,320
the rest of the poly magnetic data so

222
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,800
we can see that the intensity is the

223
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,760
parameter most affected with a very

224
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,360
scarce number of quality data in light

225
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,240
course here

226
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:11,440
but what means quality data for us

227
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,200
we use a quality criteria based on

228
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,040
uh three three principal aspects

229
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,760
the first one is the type of material

230
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,920
analyzed we choose uh ultramagnetic and

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,640
volcanic material for the analysis of

232
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,680
these

233
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,279
um rapid anomalies in the case of the

234
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,480
levantine especially in the case of the

235
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,680
levantine iron h anomaly

236
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,240
the number of specimens that we consider

237
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
is a minimum of four specimens and the

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,279
laboratory protocol

239
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,880
used for the estimation of the pali

240
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:46,320
intensity is also considerate

241
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,320
we we required that the quality that the

242
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,399
quality data correspond to intensity

243
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,680
values coming from experiments

244
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,760
based on the teleetellier type methods

245
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,959
including ptrm sex and

246
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,120
in the case if they were obtained from

247
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,160
potentially highly anisotropic

248
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,600
archaeological

249
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,120
objects such as pottery or ceramics

250
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,880
the trm anisotropy correction is also

251
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,079
required

252
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,519
this is not the case for example for

253
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,959
volcanic data

254
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,120
so unfortunately there is currently not

255
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,360
enough quality data to obtain a robust

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,440
global reconstruction of the geomagnetic

257
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,160
field using only the quality data

258
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,160
for the last three thousand years for

259
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,760
this reason we propose the use of the

260
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,120
complete database

261
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,600
not only the quality data but we use we

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
propose to use an appropriated within a

263
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
scheme

264
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,399
to do that the most difficult problem is

265
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,600
to establish the relative ratio between

266
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,600
the weight of the quality data and the

267
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,240
other parliamentary data

268
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,079
to quantify this radio we constructed

269
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,920
different geomagnetic field

270
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,519
models using different waviness schemes

271
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,200
from 1 to 100

272
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,160
with ratios from these models

273
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,880
we calculated declination inclination

274
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,800
and intensity data at the same location

275
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
than those corresponding to the quality

276
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,279
data in the original database

277
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,120
we then compare the prediction of the

278
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,000
model with the real data and we

279
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,440
calculate

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,279
the the root mean square error

281
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,040
for different regularization given by

282
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,680
different damping parameters alpha and

283
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,000
tau

284
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,519
here we can see different traits of

285
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,800
curves

286
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:43,360
and and we see very well

287
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,480
in this knee point in the trade of cars

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,600
around 10 so

289
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,920
this this uh wasting scheme

290
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,639
this means that the quality data waived

291
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,639
10

292
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
times more than the rest of the

293
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,279
parliamentary data is the best

294
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,519
compromise between

295
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,519
the modeling fitting and the proposed

296
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,120
wasting scheme

297
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:08,639
so with this consideration um

298
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,079
we generate two different reconstruction

299
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,440
of the magnetic field

300
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,600
for modeling purposes we followed

301
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
the same approach as the work of corte

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,760
and constable

303
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,839
2005 and the spherical harmonic analysis

304
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,839
technique in space

305
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,440
and the penalized cubic via splines in

306
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,200
time

307
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,959
we select the maximum degree of the

308
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,240
harmonic expression

309
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,279
equal to 10 and we fix the temporal note

310
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,120
points every 25 years in order to

311
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
estimate model and certain things that

312
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,279
was how technique is

313
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,200
used following curtin concept on

314
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,600
constable

315
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,200
2008 and

316
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,519
we calculate 5 000 models

317
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,519
by perturbing the input data with two

318
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,279
random distribution

319
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,360
allows and distribution centering the

320
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,720
mean directional and intensity values

321
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
with a standard deviation equal to the

322
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,959
uncertainty of the

323
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,800
data and a homogeneous distribution

324
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,800
center in the main age

325
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,160
of the data with an amplitude equal to

326
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079
their certainty

327
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,680
so the inversion was regularized also at

328
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,360
the current mantle boundary by means of

329
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,920
the damping parameters alpha

330
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,760
and tau and with this consideration we

331
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,600
have generated these two reconstruction

332
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,519
of the geomagnetic fields

333
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:29,279
though ionate from 1300 bc to

334
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,839
0ad and south2k

335
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,000
from 100 bc to

336
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,199
1900 the first one is

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,079
uh it's generated

338
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,519
to a study the levantine ionization

339
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,720
normally and the second one

340
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
is generated in order to study the

341
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,959
south atlantic and normally the

342
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,560
emergence and evolution

343
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,040
so from south carolina we see

344
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,240
maps of intensity at the air surface in

345
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
different years

346
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,079
during the first years of the model we

347
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,920
see moderate values of the intensity

348
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,199
around over the 11th region around 60

349
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,880
microtesla

350
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,120
around 900 bc

351
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
high values of the intensity are around

352
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,360
80

353
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,880
micro teslas are observed with an

354
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,800
apparent migration

355
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:29,600
and northwest was from 700 bc

356
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:33,199
and 550 and around 300 bc

357
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,440
we see lower values again

358
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
so

359
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
the observed high intensity at their

360
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
surface uh

361
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,839
corresponding with the levantine

362
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,600
ionization normally can be associated to

363
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,639
a flux patch of normal polarity here

364
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
of the radial component of the

365
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,279
geomagnetic field at the cormenter

366
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,399
boundary

367
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:59,120
and we see we see

368
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,199
at about 1000 bc an isolated normal flux

369
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,399
patch is located below the eleventh

370
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,440
rayon here

371
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,399
that grows up in c2 and then

372
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
it expands towards the northwest the

373
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,399
northwest

374
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:17,519
while decreasing intensity i try to

375
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,959
put in the movie again so

376
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,199
we see this section expansion

377
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,480
towards the northwest while decreasing

378
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,920
intensity

379
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,199
at around 700 b speed center is located

380
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,880
in europe and from 300 f

381
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,000
300 bc the then our normal flux path

382
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,920
is vanishing in c2 so due to the

383
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,040
non-dipolar nature of the

384
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,360
levantine iron age anomaly we have

385
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,279
also analyzed the non-dipolar terms of

386
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,279
the magnetic field

387
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,720
and we observe more or less the same

388
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,079
evolution

389
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,920
of this normal patch normal flux

390
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,920
patch at the cormentel boundary with

391
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,959
immigration northwest were from

392
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,959
1000 bc to 700 bc

393
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,000
okay for salk 2k

394
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,800
reconstruction we can see the emergence

395
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,759
of the

396
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,680
reversal flux patch related to the south

397
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,759
atlantic anomaly

398
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,279
here we can see the evolution of the

399
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,279
radial component of the hormonal

400
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,959
boundary for different times

401
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,079
as we can see an area of reverse

402
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,800
polarity located beneath

403
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,839
india penetrated from the magnetic

404
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,480
equator

405
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:40,680
and move away south west

406
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,120
from 1080 to 100

407
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,600
1380 and

408
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,720
in mil in 1700 kd

409
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
it was isolated beneath south africans

410
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,639
32

411
00:16:51,440 --> 00:17:00,320
50 was worth until reaching the south

412
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:04,480
atlantic ocean in 1980 so

413
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,199
here according to the international

414
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,600
humanitarian reference field

415
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,600
12

416
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,280
the south reversal flux patch

417
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,679
is divided into two different uh

418
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,120
reversal patches one located in

419
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
patagonia

420
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,079
and the second one located under south

421
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:30,400
africa here

422
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,120
and here so return studies indicate that

423
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,640
nowadays

424
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,559
the patagonian er erase p is vanishing

425
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,080
and the south african era is p

426
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:44,320
is reinforcing this is we can

427
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,400
see this feature here

428
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,720
our new reconstruction does not have

429
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
enough resolution to establish if the

430
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
strong

431
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,520
westward movement of this thousand

432
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,919
reversal flux patch observed between

433
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,039
1780

434
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,080
to 1900 ad

435
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,120
corresponds to a real movement of a

436
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,720
single or too close reversal flux

437
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,160
buckets

438
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,320
in addition to the this reversal flux

439
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
patch related to the south atlantic

440
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,080
anomaly we can see another

441
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,600
reversal flux patch located in the

442
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,960
northern hemisphere

443
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,880
here with this n

444
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,200
in the in the figure so

445
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,120
this uh reverse efflux patch was also

446
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,960
identified by another author

447
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:39,360
by other authors terranovital in 2015

448
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,400
around 1500 a.d and our studies suggest

449
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,720
that the emergence of this n

450
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,919
r a p occurred between 1080

451
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,440
here and

452
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,240
1 4 180

453
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,559
here when a tongue of reversal polarity

454
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,480
penetrated from the magnetic equator

455
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,559
towards the north atlantic

456
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,760
and this um this n earth hp

457
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,120
drift northeast and appeared clearly

458
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,600
isolated

459
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,280
around 1680

460
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,200
we need the united kingdom and the

461
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,000
scandinavian region

462
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,799
where it's remaining up to the date up

463
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
to now

464
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,000
uh this uh this north reversal flux

465
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,280
patch is vanishing

466
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,400
at present times as we can see

467
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,000
with uh with these figures given by the

468
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,679
international humanitarian reference

469
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
field

470
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,640
so this intriguing asymmetry

471
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,600
antisymmetric evolution of the

472
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,760
north reversal flux patch related to the

473
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,679
south reversal flux patch

474
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,760
to be investigated in more detail in

475
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,559
future

476
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,400
and finally in order to evaluate the

477
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,799
non-diaper contributions to

478
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,720
these uh reversal flux patches we have

479
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,880
also calculated the

480
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,640
the royal component of the magnetic

481
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,919
field at the core material boundary for

482
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,960
different order so

483
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,919
consider dipole quad adding quadruple

484
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,440
octopul and we saw maximum degree equal

485
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
to six

486
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,799
in this figure we saw the results

487
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,360
obtaining

488
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,840
four one thousand seven hundred kd when

489
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,720
the

490
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,480
south progressive flux patch is isolated

491
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,120
so we can clearly observe

492
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,200
that both north and south patches are

493
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,880
mainly due to harmonic degrees greater

494
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,600
than three

495
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,760
but in the case of the south reverse and

496
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,480
flux patch it's very important also the

497
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:42,000
quadrupon octopus contributions because

498
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,000
they break the symmetry of the dipole

499
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,440
venezuela africa in the case of the

500
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,840
north reversal flux patch

501
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,480
is exclusively due to non-dipole terms

502
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,600
of higher degree as we can see here in

503
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,640
the in this figure

504
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,919
so to conclude

505
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,000
yes to two points or two thoughts

506
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,120
the first one is that it seems to the

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,480
use of an appropriate

508
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,320
appropriate waiting scheme based on data

509
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
accuracy

510
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,360
seems to improve our understanding of

511
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,000
the path of the geomagnetic field

512
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,000
and the second one is something that we

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,679
know very well

514
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,440
is that we need more data more data to

515
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,360
analyze features of our

516
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,679
magnetic field and in particular to

517
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,280
analyze in detail the emergence and

518
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,480
evolution of this

519
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,520
of these anomalies so thank you very

520
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,520
much for your attention

521
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,840
thank you sayo let's give her a good

522
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
round of applause

523
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,840
um so we have

524
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,600
a couple of questions already in the

525
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,960
chat box

526
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,760
one is from lisa and she is concerning

527
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
the data selection she's asking what do

528
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,240
you do

529
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,080
about cooling rate corrections when

530
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,440
you're selecting in this case we don't

531
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,159
use the cooling rate corrections only

532
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,880
the anisotropy correction because it's

533
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,240
not very

534
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,679
clear the the real

535
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,480
uh influence of this uh of this um

536
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,039
cooling rate correction in in all the

537
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,159
time

538
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,840
i know in all type of data so in this

539
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,280
case we prefer to use

540
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:33,039
only the the this other earth

541
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,039
this other criteria

542
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:44,159
lisa do you have something to add

543
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,280
oh i mean if if you look for perfect

544
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,159
data you'll get

545
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
maybe one data point so i understand

546
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
it's just

547
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,400
it it can be a larger effect than

548
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,559
anisotropy and it's just

549
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,960
we don't know how to do it so i was just

550
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,960
asking

551
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,919
thank you okay um so that we have

552
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,520
another question from

553
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,000
andre kosterov and he asked can you

554
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
estimate

555
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,880
a deviation of field direction from the

556
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,919
expected type of values due to the

557
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,919
levantine anomaly

558
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,039
uh sorry can you repeat anita yeah sorry

559
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,600
can you estimate a deviation of the

560
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,240
field direction from the expected dipole

561
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,159
values

562
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,360
due to the eleventh time renegot

563
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,400
normally

564
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,000
in this case we we

565
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,039
center our study in the intensity

566
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
so yes we analyze also the directional

567
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,480
part of the

568
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,840
geomagnetic field but in with this

569
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,400
detail i

570
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,960
am analyzing the the intensity

571
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,000
but it's interesting because in the last

572
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,240
year

573
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,200
um new directional data

574
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,200
from from germany um

575
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,600
has been published so

576
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,960
it's interesting also to study the

577
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,840
evolution of the direction

578
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,840
in these elements

579
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,640
okay thank you

580
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,559
any other questions from the audience

581
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
andrei says

582
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:36,400
thank you

583
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
no more questions

584
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:47,840
well then thank you very much for your

585
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,840
presentation oh you have a question

586
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,559
i guess this is just a a comment really

587
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,880
in terms or a question in terms of

588
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,640
how do you think that the uh the

589
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,039
resolution of the data

590
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,600
uh that's available in in the levant

591
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,360
region and the surrounding areas

592
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,039
how does this spatial and temporal

593
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,400
resolution how do you think that

594
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,880
actually influences

595
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,240
uh what you're seeing in your models and

596
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,400
you know how much of an effect

597
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,440
does the model smoothing have

598
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,559
yes this is an interesting question in

599
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,679
the case of the

600
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:25,039
south south

601
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,559
2k we use

602
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:32,960
only the arcmagnetic volcanic data

603
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:35,679
also in the last year in 1980

604
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,000
and if you compare with the data with

605
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
the

606
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,440
model with the international humanities

607
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
reference field

608
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
that use only instrumental data and

609
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,480
satellite data we see

610
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,600
that it's very similar so yes of course

611
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,919
in the in earlier times

612
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,080
this influence is very important and

613
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,799
this is the reason also

614
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,400
to do this kind of criteria quality

615
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,880
before the model in

616
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
the modeling procedure and we also

617
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,039
filter

618
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,039
considering other statistical parameters

619
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
not only the quality of the data in

620
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,679
terms of

621
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,279
number of specimens on number or another

622
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,200
type of material

623
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,640
or laboratory protocol we also filter in

624
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,000
observe for for example the the alpha

625
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,520
95 and they were associated with

626
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,320
the intensity so yes

627
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,279
yes it's it's important this kind of

628
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,240
analysis

629
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,799
previews the the generation of the model

630
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,840
yes

631
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,559
but this is interesting the comparison

632
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,799
between

633
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,640
these two plots i think that's very real

634
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,799
i want to obtain the same result with

635
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,480
the archaeomagnetic and volcanic data

636
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,799
with instrumental and and satellite data

637
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
so

638
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,640
so i have a question um because you're

639
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,760
using

640
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,720
geomegea you don't don't even

641
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,480
have the most recent most of the data

642
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,279
for the levantine

643
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
irony which was published later

644
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,240
including the georgia

645
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,000
you refer to so um

646
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
maybe you should supplement those data

647
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,799
with the stuff that's in magic which is

648
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,559
much more

649
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:22,640
complete um uh and secondly

650
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,919
i would love to put shaw q into

651
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,520
pmagpi but i don't have

652
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,840
access to elsevier journals because i'm

653
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,840
at a university of california

654
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,880
and i believe it must be in your

655
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,880
supplemental

656
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:43,120
um is it is it in the supplemental uh

657
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,559
um material i can send you

658
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,120
if you want i can send the paper and the

659
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,679
supplementary material

660
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,559
and everything you want yeah put it

661
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,240
someplace where it's

662
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,360
open like in yes yes also in the

663
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,720
in the white side of the paleo magnetic

664
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,000
group

665
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,440
i i think that it's a good place to put

666
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,720
these these models and these

667
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,399
this code urda where where kathy

668
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,320
puts all of her models um

669
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,679
just to collect them somewhere so we can

670
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,520
have them

671
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,159
use them um uh and uh nice work thank

672
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,279
you

673
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,279
thank you very much lisa

674
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,120
thank you lisa for the for the question

675
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,760
it's really important

676
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,919
for all of us to share the data so yes

677
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
of course we can collaborate in the best

678
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,120
and

679
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,399
more consistent and clear way possible

680
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,000
we can

681
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:45,200
um so we have a question

682
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,640
in the chat from anik maybe any sugar

683
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,760
i don't know i i saw some differences

684
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,799
between your maps

685
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,919
of br at the corman's boundary

686
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,120
and those published by teranova

687
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,559
teranova do you think do you have some

688
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,159
explanation sorry

689
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:08,039
yes because in this case we include

690
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,279
uh more data than in the terranovital

691
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:13,919
2015 uh publication

692
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,120
so especially in the south atlantic and

693
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,799
the

694
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,520
in south africa and so in south america

695
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,399
so this is a different this inclusion of

696
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,399
new data here

697
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,159
okay thank you

698
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,440
uh kathy has a question

699
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,880
you can go ahead and meet yourself

700
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,880
yes a nice presentation hi i'm curious

701
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,200
if you made a model where you

702
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,679
didn't down weight the data that you

703
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,760
considered to be of low quality

704
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,480
and how that would compare with what you

705
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,480
ended up with

706
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,960
uh where exactly cathy sorry

707
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,760
so um you you showed us this slide where

708
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,000
you

709
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,360
evaluated what down waiting the data

710
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,159
that you could

711
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,640
low quality yeah and and i'm wondering

712
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,600
if you

713
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,240
looked at the results from not down

714
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
weighting

715
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,640
things and yes with what you ended up

716
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,840
with

717
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,360
yes we we generate also a model

718
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,880
considering

719
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:27,200
this wasting ratio equal to one

720
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:31,200
that is the absence of this quality

721
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:35,520
the weighting scheme and we

722
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,559
we we see we saw

723
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,600
difference in the especially in the

724
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,440
south atlantic

725
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,399
part in the in the emergence of these

726
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,960
in the observation of this evolution of

727
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,520
the

728
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,399
reversal flux patch because the south

729
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,679
africa

730
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:57,039
and south america data have

731
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,240
uh our quality data and they

732
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,559
are very scared so the the influence of

733
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,840
the

734
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,279
this quality data increase a lot when

735
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,399
you consider

736
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,840
this weighting ratio and you observe

737
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,320
better this this evolution but we

738
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,000
we can see also the evolution with the

739
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,799
with the the other model but

740
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,360
it's not so clear that when we consider

741
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,399
the

742
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,519
this weight in a scheme so

743
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,880
advent we in yes if

744
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,080
i i i can share

745
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,080
all these um models and also

746
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,159
this this other model is present in the

747
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,760
supplementary material of this paper

748
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:43,360
so so yes in the

749
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,159
next future i want to share

750
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,440
all the coefficients gauss coefficients

751
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,799
in order to

752
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,080
put all free and

753
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,679
yes and share with the community

754
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,399
that would be great and so just to be

755
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,120
clear the waiting is the only way the

756
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,919
weighting of quality versus not good

757
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,919
quality is the only way that you

758
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,600
include the uncertainty in the

759
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,840
observations you don't weight them by

760
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,880
the uncertainties assigned by the

761
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,799
original data providers yes

762
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:20,880
we consider the uncertainty of the data

763
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:24,080
only in the bootstrap method and

764
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,799
and we when we filter the data

765
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,600
uh after this waiting scheme in the

766
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,120
sense that

767
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,480
we we have uh done this waiting scheme

768
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,039
in order to

769
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,240
classify the quality of the data but

770
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,440
based on different a different way

771
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,360
and in the classical filters that we use

772
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,840
for example consider the

773
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,720
error of intensity data we filter in

774
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,840
order to

775
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,320
not underestimate or overestimate the

776
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,200
some data and these kind of things we

777
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,640
also do this before the

778
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,640
the the modeling process so

779
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,720
we include all these and the waiting

780
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,559
skin is included in the

781
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,360
story because he is having that

782
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,640
here we include the weighting skin like

783
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,230
a waste

784
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,159
mattress

785
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,200
[Music]

786
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:24,640
with ones and tens

787
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:28,240
depending on the on the quality data

788
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,360
thank you thank you thank you

789
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,200
we have another question in the chat box

790
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,840
it's from joe stunner

791
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,240
and he asks how do you test these

792
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,640
reconstructions

793
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,360
what predictions might you have make

794
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,760
that

795
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,760
we as data producers could try to check

796
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,200
i can repeat so

797
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,159
how do you test these reconstructions

798
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,799
that's the question

799
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,200
so what prediction might you make that

800
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,000
we

801
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,000
as the data producers could try to check

802
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,559
okay

803
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,599
the test of these reconstructions

804
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,879
are okay

805
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,440
for example no here no

806
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,000
we usually they calculate the estimation

807
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,359
of the root mean square compare

808
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,599
in comparison for the the model uh

809
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,280
data with the original database and we

810
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,560
calculate the root mean square

811
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,919
and this is the test that we use

812
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,040
if this um this a root mean square

813
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,159
error is very close to one

814
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,359
we consider that the model is uh

815
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,359
is doing a well work

816
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,839
okay thank you joe do you want to

817
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:53,119
ask something else

818
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,440
well i was just yeah curious if we

819
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,960
you know can can use these i mean

820
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,160
obviously we can get predictions at

821
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,000
different locations and try to see

822
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,160
how well different types of data might

823
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,280
reproduce

824
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,000
what you expect based on these

825
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,119
reconstructions

826
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,720
um if there's things in progress

827
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,520
especially data that's not say um

828
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,480
within the model so you know can we use

829
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,079
sedimentary records as ways of

830
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,079
testing what you might expect

831
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,640
yes yes i understand yes i i see your

832
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,240
point yes

833
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,359
we can in this case we don't

834
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,640
um calculate this kind of

835
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,839
test so we only calculate the root minus

836
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,040
query like

837
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,079
the previous way that i mentioned

838
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,520
but yes if you with new data

839
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,359
you can see if these models

840
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,440
works well it's for me to be honest i

841
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,240
think that for example if you uh

842
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,160
increase the number of data of quality

843
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,599
data in variance for example

844
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,400
here in the mediterranean region

845
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,200
where these data are not very quality

846
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,320
data

847
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,400
and it's possible that this model though

848
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,040
doesn't work very well here but

849
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,240
depends on the on the date this is the

850
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,920
reason why i

851
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,839
i think that it's very important to

852
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,280
increase the number of aluminated data

853
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,880
and also equality

854
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,480
equality data so

855
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,400
yes okay thank you

856
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,599
i just wanted to follow up on joe's

857
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,560
comment uh

858
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,960
if you want to make a comparison with

859
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,160
the sedimentary data

860
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,760
one of the issues that uh would be

861
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,960
important would be for the sediment

862
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,920
data gatherers to provide an estimate of

863
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,640
the

864
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,599
temporal resolution in the sedimentary

865
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,240
data

866
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,040
because if there's smoothing as a result

867
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,839
of the

868
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,160
uh remnants acquisition then you

869
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,119
wouldn't expect these models to agree

870
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,040
that well

871
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,640
because they just make predictions that

872
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,560
will be scattered about the sediment

873
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,560
curve so this is something

874
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,960
that uh that we actually tried to

875
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,640
incorporate we incorporated in the gtf

876
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,800
100k model

877
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,880
uh the idea that once you when you make

878
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,119
a prediction you have to take account of

879
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
the remnants acquisition process

880
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,720
in order to get some kind of accurate

881
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,240
result and we actually built that into

882
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,359
the modeling process

883
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,200
uh to allow for that in there so

884
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,160
uh sediment data collectors that we

885
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,839
really need to know that

886
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,839
sounds like a challenge

887
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,119
thank you for for uh this point i would

888
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
follow up also on lisa's uh comment of

889
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,240
before that

890
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,680
another good thing that we as data

891
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,320
producer can do

892
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,040
is make the original data available so

893
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,520
that yeah

894
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,359
you can you can have for instance as a

895
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,560
sedimentary sequence you have depth

896
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,680
your age where the age

897
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,800
came from in centimeter wide can in the

898
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,839
near future of

899
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,640
far future we can always reconstruct

900
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,720
uh maybe a new age model compared to

901
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,000
what we did 10 years ago or something if

902
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,400
that makes sense

903
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,800
yeah yes yes so we i completely agree

904
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
with you

905
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,359
hi i would have a question too hi

906
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,160
for this nice presentation i was

907
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,760
wondering somehow you have controlled

908
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,000
the quality of the dating of your data

909
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,920
i mean how reliable is the dating

910
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
because very often we have very

911
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:45,760
high quality data and excellent

912
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,200
laboratory results but the dating is not

913
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,280
so reliable

914
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,880
i am afraid that's often the case for

915
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,560
both volcanic rocks and

916
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,720
um magnetic material so i don't know

917
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,920
the way to control the reliability of

918
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,040
the dating yes

919
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,960
in the in this model i

920
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,079
i must say that we only

921
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:13,040
use a filter of the uncertainty of

922
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:16,400
the age consider a 2050

923
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,599
years like the maximum uncertainty

924
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,960
of age that we consider well so

925
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,400
for us then the data that we

926
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,640
use in these value magnetic

927
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,040
reconstructions

928
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,040
only consider the data with an

929
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,599
uncertainty of h

930
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:39,280
lesser than 2 500

931
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:43,200
years yes of course then

932
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,960
the best solution is to see to

933
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,480
prove to to see in detail

934
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,920
every day every day and

935
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,000
yes and if the the dating is

936
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,640
well or not or what problems

937
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,280
there are yes of course but in the case

938
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,720
of the

939
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:10,640
these models we use only this filter

940
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,760
thank you thank you thank you thank you

941
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,480
thank you we have one uh

942
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,240
one uh question from elisa in the chat

943
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,359
how does the shop compare

944
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,400
to the chinese data of kaya

945
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,640
from china we use the kaiata

946
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:32,800
data in these in this

947
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:35,680
reconstructions so it's included in fact

948
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,680
if we see

949
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,800
going to 2015 so there's more from china

950
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,680
and so it would

951
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:49,599
okay but we can see for example this

952
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,599
this patch

953
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,599
at the cormantel boundary that's

954
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,640
interesting because

955
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,440
we don't see if there is some connection

956
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,880
between these

957
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,839
two normal flux patches so

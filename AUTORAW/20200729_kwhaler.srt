1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,720
for coming uh to today's uh magnet

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,720
seminar this is the

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,320
fifth in our series so we're going

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,400
strong and we've had some

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,360
uh fantastic support from our community

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,160
so uh

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,200
thank you all very much and today we

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,600
will have

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
uh kathy whaler from the university of

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,320
edinburgh

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,320
talking to us about the uh 2016 pacific

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,680
jerk and core mantle boundary flows

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,439
derived from

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,599
uh swarm data but before we begin that

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,040
just a a quick rundown for those of you

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,320
who haven't attended one of these

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360
seminars

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,040
um our presentations will be about uh

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,520
20 to 20 uh 25 to 30 minutes long

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,200
and i kindly ask that you keep your

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
microphones mediated so that

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
background noise such as babies

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,840
screaming and crying

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,840
doesn't interrupt the seminar um

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,879
at the end of the the presentation we

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,399
will have

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,359
10 to 15 minutes for questions

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,359
you can raise your hand via zoom and we

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,400
can we'll invite you to unmute and ask

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
your question

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
if you don't want to ask an oral

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,439
question

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,680
please just type it into the zoom chat

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,520
and add the no mic uh quote to it

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,960
and then either myself or one of my

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
co-hosts will

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,680
read out the question uh for you

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,720
and as usual we're always busy so um

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,079
please just uh leave if you have to and

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
we all have life going on in the

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
background

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,000
and at the end of the seminar um we will

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
have a small chance to catch up and

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
socialize with everybody

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
and i should state that at the end of

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,799
the seminar when we have this little

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,040
networking socializing

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
uh the recording will be stopped so it's

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,360
only the seminar

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,520
and the um question and answer session

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,079
uh that will be recorded

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,280
um and so without further ado i will

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,119
hand over to our

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,119
uh presenter for today which is kathy

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,119
whaler from the university of edinburgh

56
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,640
[Music]

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,840
thanks very much greg um i'm hoping i'm

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
sharing my screen now

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
and you can see my presentation is that

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,599
right

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,300
uh not at the moment right

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,120
um

63
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,640
[Music]

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,640
share screen aha let's try this one

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
is that any better

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
yeah that's that's perfect you can see

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,280
your screen now okay

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,480
right first of all thanks very much for

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,599
the opportunity

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,400
to speak today secondly this is really

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,360
just um

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
a brief update to a presentation that i

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,360
gave at the

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,080
virtual eg meeting so apologies to for

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
those of you

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,400
who were present at that and

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,879
just one other small update um i'm

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,599
informed my co-authors that the jerk is

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,000
actually very specifically in 2017

80
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,720
so i've just changed that uh date from

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,519
2016 that was in the abstract to 2017

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
here

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,879
so let's see if i can there we go

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,920
outline i'm just going to cover where

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,360
we've got to

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,519
fro to be at this point um

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
in the research i'll talk a little bit

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,360
about the data

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,920
then i'll talk about the inversions that

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
i did

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,239
to obtain core surface flows in terms of

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
the models and how well they fit the

93
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,280
data

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
and then i'll move on specifically to

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,519
the pacific jerk

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
before including and just to say that

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,760
this is

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
uh really quite a nice um

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
i mean related to the very first talk in

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
this series by chris davis when he was

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,640
looking at very rapid

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
changes in field direction and looking

103
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,360
at the

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
field dynamics itself and i'm going to

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
do something slightly different look at

106
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
all three components of the magnetic

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,280
field from current

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,319
observations and think about the core

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,680
surface flow

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,680
that might explain them

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,720
so what i'm going to use is virtual

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,040
observatories or vos

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,760
and these are a way of reducing large

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
quantities

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,239
of satellite data to estimates of

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,959
magnetic field quantities

117
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,400
at a set of target points and as a

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
function of flight time

119
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,400
so what we're trying to do by this

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,520
process is to mimic the time series that

121
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,880
you obtained from

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,440
ground observatories so what

123
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,520
one uses to produce a vo estimator are

124
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,160
data within a vertical cylinder whose

125
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,560
axis

126
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
passes through the target point and then

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
those data

128
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,840
are reduced to values at the target

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,280
point using a potential representation

130
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,360
of local

131
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,960
potential representation i'm not going

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
to go into any of the details of that

133
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
here

134
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,040
um but just to comment that the dtu

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
group my co-authors have made several

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,400
key improvements to the

137
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,080
vo methodology this includes

138
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,160
and this is going to be the focus today

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,479
producing spatial gradients of the field

140
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,400
in addition to the magnetic field and

141
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,479
time derivatives of both the field and

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,520
the field gradients

143
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,039
so previously i've demonstrated that the

144
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,520
surface sv gradient as well as the esv

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
vo estimates can be used to infer core

146
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
surface flow

147
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,800
and uh shown that the residuals are less

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,880
biased including in

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,880
sorry indicating less contamination of

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
the data by external fields

151
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
this was definitely a problem with some

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
of the earlier

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
vo estimates and by doing a lot of work

154
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,000
the dtu

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
group have overcome a lot of those

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
issues

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,039
and i've shown that the resolution is

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,639
better for gradient data so i will show

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,479
um that we can use these gradient data

160
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,560
to produce the core surface flows and i

161
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,080
will i have got a slide to show about

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,880
the resolution but i'm not going to talk

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,600
today about

164
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:59,360
the residuals because of lack of time

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,080
so these vo estimates are derived from

166
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
sums and differences of the observations

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,000
along

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,400
and across track from the satellite data

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,479
and they're reduced to a central point

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,479
using a cubic potential description

171
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,840
which is one of the enhancements that

172
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,000
dtu group have made and

173
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,000
rather than producing monthly values

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
which is what we typically get from

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
observations they're using they're

176
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,880
producing four monthly values so that

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,120
each virtual observatory volume

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,360
is well sampled so we don't have biases

179
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,360
from the satellite orbits during the

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,360
period that's being studied

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
and then simple annual differences of

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
the field estimates provide

183
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,680
secular variation estimates and

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,479
alongside all of this process you can

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
get

186
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,520
reliable uncertainties so the inversions

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,440
that i've been done again

188
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,919
i've done they're going to be weighted

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,639
by the uncertainties

190
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,880
and the optimum arrangement of vo's

191
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
turns out to be something like 300 so

192
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
i'm going to be using

193
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,360
300 equally spaced vios and in fact i'm

194
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,199
going to be using 298 because we don't

195
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,880
use gradients from the

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,599
polar um positions and then the

197
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,400
search range i the the diameter of those

198
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,520
cylinders

199
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,400
is 700 kilometers and the correction

200
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,400
that have also

201
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,479
helped with improving these estimates is

202
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,280
to remove the crustal field

203
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,840
remove the external and its induced

204
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,039
field

205
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,800
and reduce um remove the ionospheric

206
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,880
plus its induced

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,000
field estimate as well as part of the

208
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
processing chain

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,599
and here is an example from these 300

210
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,560
virtual observatories

211
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,880
of one of the secular variation gradient

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,319
time

213
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,720
series so this is the time derivative

214
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,759
of the radial component in the radial

215
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,919
direction

216
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,360
and you'll be seeing the other five

217
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
independent components

218
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
later on so the red dots on the screen

219
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,039
here

220
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
are the positions the virtual

221
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,240
observatories they don't look equally

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
spaced here but that's just the

223
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,000
projection that's been chosen

224
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,280
and the blue dots either side of those

225
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
red dots are the time

226
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,199
series so you can see the kind of

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
variation and then in the bottom left

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,240
here

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,680
is the um scale so this is 20 pico

230
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,440
teslas per kilometer

231
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,319
per year and the time span is 2014 to

232
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,240
about 23

233
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,599
20 19. okay and as i said these are four

234
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
monthly estimates

235
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,599
and the black ellipse here we're going

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,080
to be looking at the fits

237
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,640
to the data at this virtual observatory

238
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,000
a little bit later on

239
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,000
um the 2017 pacific jerk

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
um i should have pointed this out of

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,120
course you can see that there's really

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
quite a sudden

243
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,040
change in this particular component in

244
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,120
the pacific region

245
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
at about the middle of that time series

246
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,080
which means it is about 2017.

247
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,080
okay and you can also see that in the

248
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
secular variation data themselves so

249
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
here data from

250
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,880
honolulu observatory the radio

251
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,959
the north south and the east-west

252
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,880
component of the magnetic field there or

253
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,839
sorry the secular ocean there

254
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,279
so now in nanoteslas per year and again

255
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,320
you can see this very

256
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,160
sudden change in around 2017

257
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
and certainly these two components and

258
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,000
in some extent also into the

259
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
in the fight components as well as the

260
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,440
second variation

261
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,399
so this is a locally um well-defined

262
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,480
feature

263
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,480
and i'm showing just the observatory

264
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
data here but you can also see in the

265
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,959
secular variation

266
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,920
vo data as well

267
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,880
so what kind of flows do we need to

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,279
explain

269
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,600
these changes the way we do this is we

270
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,760
assume the magnetic field is frozen into

271
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,320
the fluid at the top of the outer core

272
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,839
that means that we are assuming magnetic

273
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,040
diffusion is negligible

274
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,200
and as a result the field lines track

275
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
the flow which i've tried to illustrate

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,720
in this

277
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
little slide so we've got two times t1

278
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,640
here

279
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,000
and t2 here this black line here is the

280
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,760
core mental boundary

281
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,079
and we're looking at a cross section

282
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,079
through it so here's the out liquid

283
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,040
outer corner here's the mental above

284
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,560
and these red and blue lines here are

285
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,959
the field lines that thread the core

286
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,800
metal boundary so here the field is

287
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,560
leaving the core here it's entering the

288
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
core and i've imagined

289
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,800
a flow pattern underneath so because

290
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,079
uh field lines are tied to the parcels

291
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,519
of fluid

292
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,279
um on the core side as the fluid moves

293
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,040
it drags the field lines along with it

294
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
so if we've got a simple flow like this

295
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,320
it's just going to move

296
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,079
the pattern around so it's going to

297
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,600
drift the pattern between

298
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,279
time t1 and time t2 in the lower half

299
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,079
here we've got a different kind of

300
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,800
scenario where i'm imagining converging

301
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,120
flow at the core surface and that

302
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,000
results then by dragging the field lines

303
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,600
together in a local field

304
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,560
intensification so this is the idea

305
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
behind

306
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,160
using the objective flow assumption to

307
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,440
derive

308
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,040
the core surface flow so the equation

309
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,560
that derives that is here

310
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
so it says the rate of change of the

311
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
field or the secular version they give

312
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,120
pardon

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,160
too many clicks um is an interaction

314
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,279
between the flow

315
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,560
acting on the field so what we're going

316
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
to do is we're going to look at the

317
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,120
radial component of this

318
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,880
equation here at the core surface treat

319
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,880
it as an inverse problem

320
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,480
for the flow which has no radial

321
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,480
component at the core surface

322
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,839
because it's a material boundary so

323
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,600
we're going to look at the north south

324
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,000
and the east-west components

325
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
and we're going to derive them from the

326
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
secular variation but in fact we're

327
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
going to derive them from the spatial

328
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
gradients and the second operation of

329
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,160
those

330
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
satellite virtual observatories and we

331
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,839
assume within this process that the main

332
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
field is perfectly known and i've just

333
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,560
chosen to specify it like the chaos

334
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,959
model at the time instant each time

335
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,920
and i'm going to get a time series of

336
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,959
the flow by

337
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,720
minimizing the tempo and the spatial

338
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
complexity of the phone i'll talk a

339
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,639
little bit about that more about that

340
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,399
later on

341
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,920
so what we actually do is we expand

342
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,079
everything the field itself

343
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,760
the secular ovation and potentials

344
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,200
representing the flow in terms of

345
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,360
spherical harmonics

346
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
and that allows us to seek solutions for

347
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,800
the coefficients

348
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,440
of these potential expansions of the

349
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,200
flow which are linearly related

350
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,560
to the secularization of the secular

351
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,560
variation gradient data

352
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,120
so i said a little bit more about i said

353
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,639
earlier we're going to minimize the

354
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,200
spatial and the temporal correct

355
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,440
complexity of the flow so the way we do

356
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,480
that or regularizing it is we minimize

357
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
the epoxy

358
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,639
crop flow changes in each of our flow

359
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,839
coefficients

360
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,079
and either minimize one of these three

361
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,639
measures of the spatial complexity

362
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,519
of the flow so the first choice possible

363
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,880
choice is to

364
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,360
minimize the kinetic energy the second

365
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,320
is what's become known these days as the

366
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,000
strong norm

367
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
we're going to minimize the root mean

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,959
square second spatial derivatives and

369
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,680
i'm not going to be

370
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,000
more explicit than that and the third

371
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,160
choice this was um

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,760
a regularization i derived when i first

373
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,120
started looking at flows for a

374
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,160
completely different reason

375
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,360
but what we can do is say right i would

376
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,760
like to minimize

377
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,600
the amount of secular variation that the

378
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,639
flow generates when it interacts with

379
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,720
the field

380
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,720
so what i've actually chosen to is in

381
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,000
fact to minimize the root mean square

382
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,880
radial circulation so three really quite

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,880
different measures of spatial complexity

384
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,079
but what i hope to convince you of by

385
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
the end of the talk

386
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,240
is that they each require the same kind

387
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,519
of flow accelerations

388
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,399
to fit the data and in particular to

389
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
explain that

390
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,880
pacific junk so

391
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
very quickly moving on to the results i

392
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
was able to

393
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,440
obtain a minimum normalized misfit of

394
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,680
1.2

395
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,760
and the flows presented here have that

396
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,399
value so obviously that's slightly above

397
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,279
the

398
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,279
optimum value of one but remember that

399
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,839
we are neglecting diffusion

400
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
and so on and so forth so i was fairly

401
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,079
content with a

402
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,800
normalized misfit of 1.2 now i'm going

403
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,440
to show you

404
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,040
a movie of the flow globally in a moment

405
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,959
it shows the usual features

406
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,440
such as the band of westward flow

407
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,680
beneath the atlantic ocean

408
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,920
slower flow beneath the pacific ocean

409
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,560
because in general secular variation is

410
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,199
uh weaker there and the eccentric

411
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,839
planetary

412
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,560
gyre and what you'll see is that few

413
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,120
globally

414
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,959
very little flow changes are required to

415
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,920
achieve this misfit

416
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,279
over the um five years or so of swarm

417
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,399
data that i've

418
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,240
looked at so here is the flow and

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
uh this was actually obtained with the

420
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,800
minimizing the kinetic energy in the

421
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,240
flow

422
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
and just to give you an idea of the

423
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,560
scale the root mean square

424
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,279
flow speed is about eight kilometers per

425
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,639
year so

426
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,760
here's the eccentric planetary gyre

427
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,040
here's the band of westwood flow in this

428
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
sort of western hemisphere of the

429
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,120
hemisphere

430
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,760
centered on greenwich longitude and here

431
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,639
is the

432
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,480
lower much weaker flow slower flow in

433
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,680
the pacific hemisphere

434
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,760
and this is the rather boring movie that

435
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,839
puts that results from that i'll just

436
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,000
play it one more time

437
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,360
okay but we'll see later when we hang in

438
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,880
on the pacific that there is a little

439
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,120
bit more detail to be seen

440
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,560
there okay so before i do that i'll show

441
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,199
you how well these data

442
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,160
fit um how did well these models predict

443
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
the data

444
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
so we're going to look at the six

445
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,519
independent gradient components at that

446
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,920
virtual observatory i

447
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,880
marked with the black ellipse earlier

448
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
and

449
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,000
look at the predictions by the three

450
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,639
flows that

451
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
um using those three different spatial

452
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,600
regularizations and again

453
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,680
units pico teslas per kilometer per year

454
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,040
vertical scales you'll see vary from

455
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,839
plot to plot

456
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,720
okay now the predictions of the

457
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,440
differently

458
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,959
spatially regularized solutions feel fit

459
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,040
equally well globally

460
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,279
but they differ a little as you'll see

461
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,519
at the virtual observatory location

462
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,839
and you'll also note that regularized

463
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,040
flows under predict the amplitude of the

464
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,920
signal slightly

465
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
and relaxing regularization doesn't help

466
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,759
in any substantial

467
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,680
fashion so this is the component we were

468
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,880
looking at before in the top right

469
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:39,759
we are our component of secular ovation

470
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:42,079
um again 2014 to 2019 the blue dots here

471
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
are the data themselves and then the

472
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,720
three curves in orange grey

473
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,040
and yellow are the predictions of those

474
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,680
three different spatial complexity

475
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,600
norms so this is the strong norm the

476
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,279
strongest regularization

477
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,680
the kinetic energy norm you've just seen

478
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,720
the flow for that and the radial second

479
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
ovation norm

480
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
which i'll also show you flows for later

481
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,920
okay

482
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,160
so you can see that we're following the

483
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,079
trends in general as i say here

484
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,079
here for example you can see how we're

485
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,679
under predicting the amplitudes

486
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,360
this scale is here is a little bit

487
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,679
smaller but then you'll see these are

488
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,679
rather scattered data as well

489
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,679
and here and that is another example of

490
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,640
where we're under predicting the data

491
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
but those three flows do roughly equal

492
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,959
jobs in

493
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,559
fitting the data so i hope you can

494
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,720
believe that globally

495
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,720
they fit to it at the same extent

496
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,360
okay so let's look at the pacific jerk

497
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,960
in 2017

498
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,799
and i'll try to convince you that

499
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,440
there's a localized increase

500
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,200
in eastwood flow speed particularly in

501
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,320
the western part of the pacific north of

502
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
the equator

503
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,919
and there's a westward acceleration

504
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,360
south of the equator

505
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,799
and these flow changes are inserted in

506
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,880
sensitive to the form of spatial

507
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,559
regularization the flows themselves are

508
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,760
really quite different so

509
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,200
i was quite stunned when i found that

510
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,480
the changes themselves

511
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:09,039
are very very similar

512
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,080
so this is the pacific region here um

513
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,679
and this is the strong norm flow and

514
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,679
again i'm going to show you a video i've

515
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,200
put lots more arrows on here to look at

516
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,840
this small region

517
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,720
and i hope if i play it again you'll see

518
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,600
how this

519
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,320
eastwood flow here is intensifying at

520
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,799
around

521
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,360
jerk speed time okay there are some

522
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,360
other

523
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,679
notable changes over this side as well

524
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,400
but to explain the pacific

525
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,000
uh jerk you know in this region um we're

526
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,280
probably looking at these kind of

527
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,480
pictures here

528
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,320
i'll play one more time okay

529
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,799
so that's really quite a pronounced

530
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,799
feature

531
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,280
now these are the flows for different

532
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,440
spatial

533
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,760
regularizations i've just chosen one

534
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,160
epoch from within that you've seen how

535
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,080
little temporal variability there is so

536
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,000
this is the kinetic energy norm

537
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,000
this is the strong norm so you'll see

538
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
that we're more strongly regularized so

539
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,679
we're allowing

540
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,600
less spatial structure than within the

541
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,400
connect with the kinetic energy norm

542
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,160
and this has got a reference vector on

543
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,039
which applies to all three

544
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,280
and this is the flow that minimizes the

545
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,679
amount of radial circular evolution

546
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,919
when it acts on the magnetic field and

547
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,120
you'll see it's quite a bit stronger

548
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,160
um certainly there's no real sense of

549
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,799
weaker

550
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,360
slower flow beneath the pacific um in

551
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,880
general

552
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,480
although there are some places where

553
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,320
that's true and the

554
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,400
the eccentric gyrus is less well-defined

555
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,559
i would say and there are some other

556
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,280
really quite strange

557
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,400
rapid sorry small scale upwellings and

558
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
downwards so

559
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,320
i'm not suggesting that that's

560
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,559
necessarily a physically realistic flow

561
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
but it's again one that fits the data

562
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,200
and we will again we will see

563
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,440
shortly that the changes that we need to

564
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
explain the data with this flow are the

565
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,600
same essentially as with these two

566
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,840
planes as well

567
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,799
okay so the way i'm going to try and

568
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,600
show you that is

569
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,919
by calculating the acceleration and i've

570
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,000
just done that as successive

571
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,240
flow differences so i'll take i've

572
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,400
subtracted

573
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,559
the epoch before from a given epoch and

574
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,159
use that to define the acceleration

575
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,240
and i've not done any smoothing or

576
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,760
anything like that and you can also see

577
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,360
these same kind of differences

578
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,039
these um features if we look at the

579
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,799
differences from the mean and i do have

580
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,880
videos of those at the end

581
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,520
and they're slightly less noisy than the

582
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,880
acceleration as you can imagine

583
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,400
okay so here's the flow acceleration for

584
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,520
the struggle

585
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,760
i apologize the scale vector is uh

586
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,200
factor three too large which you can't

587
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
really see it very well anyway so i'm

588
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,360
going to play

589
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,360
this movie okay

590
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,840
and you can see around the jerk time

591
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,520
this start this feature starts to show

592
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,200
this eastwood acceleration and in fact

593
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,480
there's a counterbalancing

594
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,240
um westward acceleration to this and

595
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,559
slightly off to the southwest and these

596
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,559
features also seem to be robust

597
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,559
between the three different workflow

598
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
regularized stations i've chosen so i'll

599
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,240
play this

600
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,400
one more time okay we'll see some other

601
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
circulations giants

602
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,559
in the acceleration show up here as well

603
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,640
as we as we go through the time sequence

604
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,559
but that's the strong law here's the

605
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,200
kinetic energy norm you'll see there's

606
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,840
slightly more energy in uh converging

607
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,799
and diverging

608
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,320
accelerations which is slightly

609
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,360
difficult to get your head around

610
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,600
your mind and again we see at the end

611
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,039
an eastwood acceleration here westward

612
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,880
acceleration here

613
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:46,080
south westward and here northeast here

614
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,080
as we saw in the last one with some

615
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,240
other features that are consistent

616
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,919
in between but it's hard to stop the

617
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,840
video reliably to

618
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,520
to show you those and finally the um

619
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
the norm that produces a slightly

620
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,640
strange flow

621
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,559
uh that minimizes the amount of

622
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,480
predicted circulation and again you'll

623
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,400
see the snapshot here showing a very

624
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,960
similar feature

625
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
acceleration at the start and as we go

626
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,679
through

627
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,720
very similar acceleration the end south

628
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,799
westward here

629
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,440
north eastward here eastward and

630
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,440
westward there

631
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,960
so i i would claim that we've um

632
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,039
identified features of the flow or

633
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,520
changes in the flow that are required to

634
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,240
fit

635
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,400
those circulation gradient data so we've

636
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,960
produced satisfactory flow models

637
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
derived only from the gradient data i

638
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,679
haven't put

639
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,880
any actual secularization data in

640
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,120
themselves

641
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,799
as we've seen globally very little flow

642
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
changes required

643
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,960
um to start these temporally and

644
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,760
spatially regularized flows

645
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,799
slightly under predictable jet amplitude

646
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,120
in these

647
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,280
uh gradient data and that's certainly an

648
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
experience i've had before

649
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,280
where they are they under predict

650
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,000
secular variation day to themselves

651
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,600
and what we've seen i hope is that 2017

652
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
jerk involves an eastwood flower

653
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,760
acceleration

654
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,840
in the central pacific near the equator

655
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,840
and i will stop there thank you

656
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,280
excellent thank you very much kathy um

657
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,000
so we can all give

658
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,640
kathy a virtual uh applause uh through

659
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
zoom

660
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
it's a really uh interesting talk thank

661
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,200
you

662
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:35,919
and i will open the floor now to um

663
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:37,200
anybody with some questions for kathy

664
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,400
well i guess i'll kick off

665
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,880
uh the questions um when you're looking

666
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,320
at the

667
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,679
the um different regularizations

668
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,760
you know you're seeing very different um

669
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,039
globally speaking very different flow

670
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,320
patterns

671
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,840
um are there any consistent features

672
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,880
other than what you're looking at in

673
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,600
pacific

674
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,480
that that that would be robust features

675
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,400
in these different

676
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,039
models let me go back to showing my

677
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,480
screen

678
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,480
and um

679
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,559
so you know how they say beauty is in

680
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,559
the eye of

681
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,960
the beholder and all that so

682
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,360
i mean i would say that the gyre is

683
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,919
identifiable in all three so here's this

684
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,279
pacific gyre this is the enhanced

685
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,960
feature in the um

686
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,960
sort of above the bering strait at the

687
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
cormental boundary that uh

688
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,360
bill livermore's looked at with chris

689
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,480
finley from swarm data

690
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,120
down here round back up again they've

691
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
all got

692
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,279
a band of westwood flow

693
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
across the hemisphere centered on

694
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,600
greenwich

695
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,559
here a little bit less obvious and

696
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,080
the gyre is kind of a little bit

697
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,880
different in this case but

698
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,720
uh i suspect if you filter that flow

699
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
just to look at these spherical

700
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,799
harmonics that were

701
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,720
most representative of the gyre you

702
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,520
would see those same features

703
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,440
um i haven't looked at a comparison

704
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
between the power spectra to see if

705
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
there are any sort of shapes that are

706
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,760
similar there but

707
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,000
um you can you can identify

708
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,799
some features that seem to be consistent

709
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,559
i mean there's

710
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,600
another one here would be this small

711
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,080
um eddie okay

712
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,799
less well resolved here because of the

713
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,720
um

714
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:38,240
increased um damping or regularization

715
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,000
of small scale features so

716
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,640
there are some features that are similar

717
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,760
but it's perhaps harder to

718
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,080
um identify them particularly in this

719
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,080
play

720
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:57,679
um constable has a question

721
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:01,279
yeah uh i have to confess i'm a little

722
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,039
uh struck by the fact that uh the

723
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,480
jerk occurs in the place where the

724
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,559
secular variation

725
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,520
is weakest and um i'm wondering

726
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,120
if this is telling us something about uh

727
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,080
changes that are coming in the pacific

728
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,279
hemisphere

729
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,799
potential i would have thought there's a

730
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,960
good chance that it is

731
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,480
yes um i mean it's certainly

732
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,320
maybe i should have prepared a slide

733
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,960
also of the virtual observatories

734
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
throughout the

735
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,480
region because obviously people were

736
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,159
arguing oh well you don't see the

737
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,919
changes because we've only got a few

738
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,840
spots where we can actually

739
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,520
measure the field at the observatories

740
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,200
but once you do look throughout the

741
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,880
whole of the pacific using virtual

742
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,320
observations you do see very very

743
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,600
consistent features with

744
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,039
in general as you say low secularization

745
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,760
but now this

746
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,760
certainly this well-defined jerk seen

747
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,400
first in honolulu but certainly

748
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,000
throughout that local area very well

749
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,640
resolved in the

750
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,240
virtual observatory data so yes i'm sure

751
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
that it is telling us something about

752
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
that

753
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,200
do you have any further questions for

754
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,200
kathy

755
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,799
so i guess i have a question i don't

756
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,159
know if you have

757
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,399
seen it um there was a recent paper

758
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,360
in neutral geoscience which was

759
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,919
inferring

760
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,640
um high quantity high conductivity

761
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,480
mantle

762
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,960
under the pacific which is explaining

763
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,320
this low secular variation

764
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,120
given the fact that we see a jerk

765
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,000
uh what does that suggest then about the

766
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,200
conductivity

767
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,559
in the mantle in that region

768
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,799
um the simple answer

769
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,960
to that question would be you know that

770
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,440
that i mean

771
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,679
connectivity will screen out the changes

772
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,039
will stop them propagating through but

773
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,840
um as george backus showed back in 83

774
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:01,039
you can get a combination

775
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,120
of field changes um that that will

776
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,840
propagate and be seen

777
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,520
as a as a rapid change a jerk like

778
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,000
feature at the surface

779
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,120
regardless of the actual conductivity of

780
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,440
the mantle

781
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,840
and in particular and there's very

782
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,159
little screening if your connectivity is

783
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,720
um

784
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,600
concentrated close to the the core

785
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,840
mental boundary

786
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,360
indeed double prime for instance then

787
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,080
this

788
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,760
is very much weaker and i think that

789
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,440
tends to be where people want to put

790
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,279
high conductivity you know with things

791
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,039
like post-cross sky and iron in the

792
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,799
elemental

793
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:44,799
so it it's not a barrier to having

794
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:46,240
rapid circulation at the surface

795
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,640
so we've got some a little bit of time

796
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,640
for any more comments or questions i see

797
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
uh richard holm leaving his hands

798
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,440
hey kathy so i was struck by your

799
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,279
vertical

800
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,880
virtual observatories by just how sharp

801
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,120
these features are in the data and

802
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,679
these features are not measurements of

803
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,559
secular variation they are

804
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,240
annual averages in effect of what the

805
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,279
real secular variation is

806
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,880
and yet they're very very sharp now

807
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,240
you can't invert them directly and i've

808
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,919
been just trying to do some this is

809
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,960
related to the stuff i did on rotation a

810
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,480
few years ago

811
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,159
um you can't invert them directly but

812
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,440
you can come up with some kind of ideas

813
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,080
and the field changes don't just have to

814
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,000
be sharp

815
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,320
they have to the second version has to

816
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,679
jump in order to get the average coming

817
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,240
out of such a sharp v

818
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,799
shape anything it's not an average it's

819
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,200
just

820
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,720
two annual differences there's two

821
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,760
differences of values

822
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
yes that is the equivalent of if you're

823
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,480
trying to plot secular variation that's

824
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,360
equivalent of an annual

825
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,080
annual mean yeah yeah it's close to an

826
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,000
annual meeting

827
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,760
yes and then if you have these really

828
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,279
sharp changes

829
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,279
that's quite a strong change

830
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,799
yeah i mean this this is a problem we've

831
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,960
been looking for ages but just your

832
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,399
data are quite so sharp and of course

833
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,480
your flows don't come up

834
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,200
dtu's data not mine i've just been

835
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,080
inverting them but your group status

836
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,279
your talk statement unless niels wants

837
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,320
to argue with me he was

838
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,799
there somewhere um but nonetheless

839
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,080
these things are very very sharp when

840
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,240
you think about how they're constructed

841
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,360
in terms of first differences

842
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,720
and any thoughts on that no and that's

843
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,120
one of the things that the

844
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,039
dtu group are looking at in terms of

845
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,240
their um

846
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,760
their virtual observatory

847
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,919
calculations so that they've been

848
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,039
producing these as part of these swarm

849
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,240
disc um enterprise as it were

850
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,720
so they've looked at uh and

851
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
clearly what you get is um a spatial

852
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,240
temple trade-off

853
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,080
so you can make smaller vo you know you

854
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,159
can average over a smaller

855
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,840
area if you're willing to take longer

856
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,440
times or if you want a shorter time

857
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,399
scale then you need to take a bigger

858
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,720
volume

859
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,240
to get a meaningful average so there's

860
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,679
there's some kind of trade-off

861
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,120
there and so you could optimize

862
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,919
to look at the temporal variability

863
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,919
i suspect

864
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,159
even without doing it they are very very

865
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,559
sharp

866
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,399
they're they're pretty sharp yeah and um

867
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,240
i haven't you know what i should

868
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,480
should have done and what we've been

869
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,240
encouraging the dtu group is to put on

870
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,880
the error bars as well so

871
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,880
as i mentioned they've calculated um

872
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,240
variances of each of those data points

873
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,880
so you can actually see

874
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,679
that they they are well resolved within

875
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,360
you know them

876
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,679
those are bigger changes than the

877
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,360
uncertainties well me being me i don't

878
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,120
worry too much about error balance but

879
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,880
the fact that they shot so consistently

880
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,640
looking like that

881
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:54,159
says no there's something there yeah

882
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,919
yeah i agree with you

883
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,480
but i can't offer any further insight

884
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,480
i'm afraid

885
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,320
cool thank you um we can have time to

886
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,640
squeeze in

887
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,640
uh one more question if anybody has one

888
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,679
no i guess not um so thank you very much

889
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,080
kathy that was a

890
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,039
a really uh interesting talk and a lot

891
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,799
of uh

892
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,519
valuable and interesting questions here

893
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,240
so um everyone like to thank kathy once

894
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,559
again for

895
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:32,159
for her talk um

896
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,039
before we all disappear

897
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,559
um i would just like to to make a quick

898
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,919
announcement for the

899
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,799
uh upcoming seminars uh in in the coming

900
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,200
weeks

901
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,000
uh so in two weeks on august 12th we

902
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,919
have

903
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
uh courtney sprain from the university

904
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,880
of florida uh giving us a presentation

905
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,440
um but as we come to the end of summer

906
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,559
we still have some some open slots

907
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,000
so if anybody is interested in

908
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,080
uh giving a presentation please um

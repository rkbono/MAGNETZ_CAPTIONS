1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,080
welcome to the magnet seminars

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,320
uh these magnets are hosted by myself

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,880
anita dicker and greg patterson

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,240
with the help of um uh michael grafoni

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,759
and nick

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,920
nick van der bon and richard bono and

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,279
that we think and the logo is by simon

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
lloyd

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,000
the seminal format is as usual uh it's

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,000
25 minutes presentation

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,039
uh where everybody's invited to keep

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,720
microphone

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,760
off and then after that would be

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
10 15 minutes question discussion uh

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
text questions always welcome and we

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
will leave time

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
uh to answer to the speaker and you're

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
invited to have um

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
to write in the chat nomic if you want

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,760
to

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,440
to read your question up it's an

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,840
informal environment so if you need to

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
go

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
don't worry about it the semis are

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,280
recorded

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,600
and there is gonna be time to catch up

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,320
as usual after the seminar and that's

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,400
not going to be recorded

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,720
so um joining me in welcoming today's

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
speaker is andrey coster from saint

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,200
peter's book

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,560
some petersburg state university and

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
and andre is going to talk about

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,159
magnetic minerals in archaeological

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,159
ceramics

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:24,479
old wine skins and new wine

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,520
okay you're welcome to share your screen

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,280
i will myself

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,280
all right right moment

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:40,240
does it work now can you see my screen

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,880
yes thank you great thank you i needed

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
wakes

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,920
thank you very much for having me here

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
for making

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
the seminar and i would like to

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
acknowledge my

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,119
uh collaborators on this project from

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,399
sofia

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,240
maria castadine and maria

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,920
and my also my colleagues from saint

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,399
peter's

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,320
institute in saint petersburg and

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,119
through moscow

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,560
and as you as we all know the

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:15,120
empty electromagnetism is a

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,800
subject of geomagnetism with long and

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,760
distinguished history so

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:28,719
okay next slide yeah

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,719
[Music]

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
and the field

61
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,319
[Music]

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,400
and the field is uh alive and vibrant

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,640
uh these days and very recently

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
recently this month a feature article

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,120
has been published in

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,879
physics world which is a newsletter for

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
institute of physics uk which got very

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,440
appropriately digging up

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,159
magnetic clues and those clues um of

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,840
course the

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,080
behavior of the magnetic field of the

72
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,040
[Music]

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,800
centennial and millennial scale which is

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,000
of so much interest to

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,120
geodynamo model models but

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,480
one phrase in this otherwise very

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,760
very good readable account has

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,040
stopped my attention i read it

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,159
i know the field of archaeomagnetism

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,840
relies on the fact

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,560
that clay so uh

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
other materials containing magnetic

83
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,040
mirrors

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,920
usually magnetites and so forth and i

85
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
highlighted two words here which i don't

86
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,580
agree with

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
because

88
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,560
[Music]

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,560
definitely the materials that

90
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,000
conceited our artifacts do contain the

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,720
magnetic mirrors but uh

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,920
but but it's not always the case for for

93
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,120
the starting material

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,640
if we understand it this way and that's

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,799
the second and most serious

96
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,040
misconception is that

97
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,640
the this magnetic mirror is claimed to

98
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,919
be magnetite which is

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,680
which which is simply

100
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,919
not true in most in most cases

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,120
not in all cases i would i will see

102
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,919
come to it later but in most cases it's

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,919
true and so

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,880
this brings us back to the

105
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,400
[Music]

106
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,600
to the medium that keeps our records

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,120
and without which we could not have this

108
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
record at all

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,720
this brings up to the magnetic

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,400
meterology of the

111
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,919
archaeological artifacts and it's a bit

112
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:00,400
it came to me as a bit of surprise that

113
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,240
when i started working on this topic

114
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,960
that

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
the serious attention to the magnetic

116
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
meteorology has

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,919
has not begun until near approximately

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,919
mid 90s when these three papers

119
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,919
with this

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:29,600
italian titles have been published and

121
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:34,960
at that time and even the first

122
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,960
experiments has shown that

123
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,680
something very very different from what

124
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
we

125
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,720
normally expect in environment examples

126
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,400
is often observed in

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,440
artifacts in this figure you can see the

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,479
one of the samples from huge

129
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,600
collection kept in sofia

130
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,880
and the three axis lower

131
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,990
test shows a very uh

132
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
tremendous drop of heart

133
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,560
[Music]

134
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,199
to tesla component of monetization below

135
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,319
below something like 240 degrees

136
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,600
centigrade

137
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:21,840
and if then if you look at the

138
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,840
irm acquisition curve we see that um

139
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,960
we see that

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,000
at least half of the monetization is

141
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,039
acquired

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,400
above 300 milli test

143
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,759
at that time the authors

144
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,880
[Music]

145
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,400
preferred the preferred to call this

146
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,160
phase geotight

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,080
which is of course cannot be true

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,199
because since

149
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,319
then this brick would consist 50 percent

150
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
of good height

151
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,639
which is which

152
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,639
which is not possible of course and

153
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:06,319
so we have to seek for um

154
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,360
alternative explanations so that

155
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:13,120
that's it for it and it took another

156
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,080
roughly 10 years that this phase

157
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,400
demagnetizing below 200 degree

158
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,800
centigrade it has

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,520
has been recognized as a separate entity

160
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,199
and called high conservative

161
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,440
thermally stable low and working

162
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,759
temperature magnetic phase by

163
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,880
making persian dollars and

164
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:39,039
more recent studies has shown that this

165
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,400
this phase is uh very often seen in

166
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,319
in bricks tiles portraits

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,560
and so forth from

168
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,840
many locations around even more recently

169
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,120
spanish groups joined with america

170
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,039
again they has suggested they

171
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:05,919
have suggested that this

172
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,680
h acslt phase could be

173
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,240
it could be related to a particular

174
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
polymorphic form of iron three oxide

175
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,639
which is called

176
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,120
epsilon iron three oxide

177
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,400
okay just uh to summarize this

178
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,680
introduction

179
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,680
um what do we know from

180
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,240
about the magnetic neurology of

181
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,080
archaeological artifacts

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,200
they all they always contain a soft

183
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,279
magnetically soft face and uh

184
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,839
very often one or two magnetically hard

185
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,839
phrases for magnetic

186
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,039
[Music]

187
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,920
magnetic analysis normally a yoga yield

188
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,640
yields security temperatures around

189
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,560
above

190
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,560
500 degrees centigrade which is

191
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,279
compatible with many type of

192
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,839
she might but on the other hand

193
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,320
the very transition which is would be

194
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,360
indicative of stopping

195
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,360
has been seldom reported

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,680
never reported from ceramics and finally

197
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
they allow three exercise and tests to

198
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,080
reduce

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,480
the quite often reveals the magnetic in

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
the

201
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,000
heart face without walking temperatures

202
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,680
around two below 200 degrees centigrade

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,580
sometimes like

204
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,360
so instead of

205
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,040
[Music]

206
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,080
sometimes single minerals examples we

207
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,000
have to deal with at least three

208
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,200
magnetic phases which uh

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,959
magnetic maximize hematite and

210
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,120
also a this hc slt phase

211
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,560
all mixed in various proportions

212
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,680
depending on

213
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,720
and so um on the

214
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,680
uh yet another consideration is that

215
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
uh starting material for making ceramics

216
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,320
doesn't contain

217
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,320
those minerals nobody well nobody knows

218
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,480
[Music]

219
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,440
and so those magnetic phases has has to

220
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,880
be produced

221
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,000
during the firing process

222
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,440
uh whether it was intentional or not

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,959
and so we can hope that uh

224
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,680
by by investigating the language

225
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,920
we can learn something about the making

226
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,040
of the manufacturing

227
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,200
process as well so

228
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,920
this was a background of our project

229
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,800
that's used to

230
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,079
the samples back wait wait for a break

231
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,560
from archaeological

232
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:08,399
sites in bulgaria very rich

233
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,839
they have very rich selection

234
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,930
in there and also some breaks from

235
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,240
more recent times in russia

236
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,519
[Music]

237
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,839
mostly the second meeting in bc

238
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
andre i apologize for interrupting but

239
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
um could you talk just

240
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,839
um facing forward to the microphone it's

241
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,839
just it's yeah

242
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,120
yeah the hearing is a bit problematic

243
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,399
yeah okay i'll try

244
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
yeah and the methods we we used apart

245
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,120
from the standard

246
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,480
error magnesium method both the irm

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,120
acquisition and dc demagnetization

248
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,320
curves measured at high temperatures up

249
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,600
to

250
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,000
well up to above 600 but actually it

251
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,839
depends on the sample of course

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,399
also we measured some magnetic curves

253
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
in the cryogenic temperature range from

254
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,000
two kelvin to

255
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,639
room temperature and also acquired the

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,839
hysteresis loops and dcd curves

257
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
will filter the several tesla fields

258
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
which is

259
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,600
which is essential uh when i'm working

260
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,040
with syrix now

261
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,720
briefly to the results and here

262
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,360
you can see the room temperature uh

263
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,760
seven tesla heights with this loops so

264
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,800
uh

265
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:39,040
roll side black correct uh

266
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,040
corrected for hyphen slope i

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,959
immediately see that uh this hot face is

268
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,160
really hard

269
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,320
we we don't saturate the monetization

270
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,720
even in seven tesla fields and the loops

271
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,480
are

272
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,680
open until until three or four tesla

273
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,880
and of course uh just comparing

274
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,880
the comparing the figurative

275
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,200
points that they plot from

276
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
seven tesla loops and from one point

277
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
eight test

278
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
loops we can see that the name for uh

279
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,519
for the same

280
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,320
for the same specimen they could uh

281
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,279
plot in quite different parts of the

282
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,480
diet

283
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,279
and about the only

284
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,839
thing about the only thing in common is

285
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,120
that

286
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,800
we have relatively high mls over

287
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,639
medication and relatively high

288
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,760
acidity we should expect

289
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,120
from a mixture of soft and hard faces

290
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,440
so now

291
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
more

292
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,839
more advances

293
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:59,040
monetization versus temperature here

294
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,250
here i plot srm and higher which is the

295
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,680
simpler

296
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,839
[Music]

297
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,839
part

298
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,460
[Music]

299
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:23,199
are their ratio and we can see that the

300
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,120
in this uh

301
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,199
those samples those samples from

302
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,800
bulgaria were selected specifically

303
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,600
to contain the hcs phase

304
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
but still we can see that they behave

305
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,240
they all

306
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,920
have this decrease of uh

307
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,720
hrms elimination towards

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,079
200 centigrade but afterwards the

309
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,839
behavior could be

310
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,120
quite different and in at least three of

311
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,320
these samples

312
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,320
we also have a significant

313
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,440
hematite phase about the same in

314
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,480
in two out of four samples from

315
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,920
uh russia sampled in uh

316
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,120
near yara's level but

317
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,000
there are also other samples that's that

318
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,480
are magnetic

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
also magnetically hard but still they

320
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
don't have

321
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:22,079
much of the hcl something okay

322
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:26,800
and have something like substituted

323
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,800
quite strongly substituted hematite

324
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,639
up to about maybe 300 or

325
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,759
400 degrees centigrade and then it

326
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,880
goes steadily down so it should

327
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,000
must be some form of some form of hammer

328
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,120
effect

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,880
now just with the

330
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,440
if we look at the temperature dependence

331
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,360
of the

332
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,519
caustivity uh we know in the hcs

333
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
anti-phases where a phase which is the

334
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,519
way it is

335
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,959
the most interesting we can say we can

336
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
typically observe

337
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,160
we typically observe the behavior that's

338
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,959
the

339
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,639
cause of force drops quite sharply

340
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,160
between

341
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,360
uh 40 degree centigrade and 160 and then

342
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,560
a little little sound and the

343
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,759
anatomy of these behaviors that is

344
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,839
is very straightforward in at room

345
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,279
temperature and

346
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,160
slightly above where the

347
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,360
zero magnetization axis is caused in the

348
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,759
heart phase

349
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:44,320
but starting at approximately

350
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:48,720
probably at 180 which is shown there is

351
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,120
a bold yellow yellow curve

352
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
the the crossing occurs already in the

353
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,000
soft phase

354
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,800
and uh so the costs

355
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,040
above 1 180 are more almost

356
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,319
indistinguishable

357
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,079
so my uh my favorite

358
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
my otherwise favorite uh technique they

359
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,160
will

360
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,199
tell them unfortunately for ceramics it

361
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,880
does not produce

362
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:21,919
anything uh

363
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,439
evidence for what these phases are

364
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,959
apart from maybe the uh

365
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,959
from hematite

366
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,799
maybe hematite in 2020

367
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,919
and to sum up

368
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:44,080
we do have acslt phase and

369
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,230
another the second part of the talk

370
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,279
would be

371
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,279
[Music]

372
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:59,600
and so just

373
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,880
epsilon iron oxide as i've known

374
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,400
the material science

375
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,679
is a peculiar uh polymorphic

376
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,880
form of iron three oxide

377
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,039
which crystallizes in the earth often on

378
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,039
the

379
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:25,930
[Music]

380
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,280
at room temperature exceeding one

381
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,400
exceeding two teslas in most perfect

382
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,559
cells

383
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,200
and in this very carefully orchestrated

384
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,200
synthesis

385
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,209
[Music]

386
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,360
one can obtain uh four

387
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,960
uh four polymorphic forms of iron iii or

388
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,360
oxide depending on the uh

389
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,240
calcination temperature which is which

390
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,000
shows

391
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,039
here which is shown here with

392
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,640
numbers and another

393
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,460
important uh takeaway from this

394
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,880
from this study is that

395
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,919
[Music]

396
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,760
epsilon iron oxide has a very narrow

397
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,840
stability uh stability field in terms of

398
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,240
grain size

399
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:35,360
after the particles larger than

400
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,280
30 nanometers again

401
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,799
once again in this highly perfect

402
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,919
highly very perfect perfect

403
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:49,600
synthetic root particles

404
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,880
larger than 30 nanometers had become

405
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,840
unstable and transformed first

406
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,160
bitter iron outside and finally to

407
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
hammer

408
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,440
what is and

409
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,080
also the at that time to the temperature

410
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
of the

411
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,000
epson phase was believed to have to be

412
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,919
around 500

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,919
kelvin but it all um

414
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
it was cast

415
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,840
with this paper by garcia muniz and the

416
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,240
others who

417
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,360
who showed that in fact this feature is

418
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,840
not uh

419
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,720
is not a real curry temperature but

420
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,360
rather

421
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,080
the temperature which shows where the

422
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,000
transition

423
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,559
comes from between two phases

424
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,919
which which are both ordered very

425
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,480
magnetically but

426
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,960
in a different way and the absolute what

427
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
we

428
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,600
what is known as epsilon 3

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,480
absolute hard phrase it has much higher

430
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,679
magnetization

431
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,840
and much higher core series than the

432
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,640
high temperatures but still the high

433
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:09,360
temperature phase has according to

434
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
up to 40 million

435
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,480
and not not non-negligible

436
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,440
uh magnetization which might maybe of

437
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,760
importance in

438
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,440
in the context of archaeomagnetism of

439
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,600
course

440
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,840
so uh a bit more a bit more

441
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:33,600
from the literature at cryogenic

442
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:37,520
it's in a very straight strange way

443
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,799
it has a quite

444
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,080
decent coarsivity at 4 kelvin

445
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,640
about 700 milli tesla then

446
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,520
the hysteresis nearly collapses at

447
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,360
between

448
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,159
85 and 100 kelvin and then develops in

449
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,120
the

450
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,080
group which is

451
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,360
[Music]

452
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,440
which is a trademark of this

453
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,799
iron oxide at room temperature the

454
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,440
facilities

455
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:10,870
as i talked about to test the

456
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,960
susceptibility versus temperature of the

457
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,960
[Music]

458
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,880
temperature depends it would be

459
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:37,280
[Music]

460
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,280
could probably serve as a uh

461
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,960
as a discriminant for

462
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,799
started with a

463
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,200
highest resistance measurement and it

464
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,679
has

465
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,120
much smaller cursivity but still the

466
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,840
corset is

467
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,159
above 100 milli tesla apart apart from

468
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,600
this

469
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,640
range around 100k and

470
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,919
so even so that means that

471
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,320
even the smallest epsilon particles

472
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
could be

473
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,640
it could carry the magnetic signal at

474
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,880
room temperature

475
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,120
so all this

476
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,720
all these previous measurements have

477
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,440
been done at highly perfect

478
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,039
highly perfect material using the

479
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,919
approaches that are

480
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,520
common in magnetic material sense and so

481
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,880
we decided to

482
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,880
perhaps that perhaps we could produce

483
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:54,000
less perfect and

484
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,200
the less perfect material that would

485
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,720
resemble

486
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,200
the archaeomagnetic sample a bit more

487
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,080
and so we did we did that using the

488
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,960
quick and

489
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,320
dirty method so in which where the

490
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,720
silica gels were

491
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,200
impregnated two different silica gels

492
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,919
were impregnated with a precursor

493
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,320
on the precursor and then they cosined

494
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,240
at

495
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:22,080
900 degrees centigrade for four hours

496
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,480
there you can see that depending on the

497
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,080
gel

498
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,039
you used the samples uh

499
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,720
different color but that one contains

500
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,360
obviously more hematite

501
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,480
as you can see in the thermo magnetic

502
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,840
curve

503
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,039
as well and that one contains uh

504
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,159
obviously less temperature and

505
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,080
we also we also see

506
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,559
that the transition temperature of

507
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,880
epsilon phase is a bit different

508
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,679
in these two cases but

509
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,360
the on the other hand they have to be

510
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,960
this properties

511
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,120
at room temperature has shown something

512
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,480
something really very very strange

513
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,640
particularly for this

514
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,840
bronzer for example it's well it's

515
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,799
more or less similar to what we would

516
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,840
expect

517
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:21,200
in serene in some ceramics at least

518
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:25,200
consider it is high but

519
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:29,039
but not as high as you as you would

520
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,520
expect for perfect synthetic capsule

521
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,080
epsilon phase conservative remnants is

522
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,279
also

523
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,159
quite high and higher than we normally

524
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,679
see

525
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,120
but otherwise this sample resembles a

526
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,200
little bit

527
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,440
a little bit the behavior we saw in

528
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
there

529
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,720
in the surrounding circles but the brown

530
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,919
sample

531
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,799
is a is an enigma for for us at the

532
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,000
moment

533
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,919
and uh i i plotted it here just

534
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,120
uh just to show what could happen

535
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,520
uh and obviously

536
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,520
it has

537
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,000
we can see here the result of uh

538
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,480
coexistence of uh

539
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,200
two phases with extremely contrasting

540
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,240
coercivity the recursive force

541
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,919
on the major loop is about

542
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,600
four marker tesla but the loop is

543
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,159
uh remains open up to four uh

544
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,360
sorry milli tesla of course the military

545
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,039
but the loop itself

546
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:43,440
remains open uh

547
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,960
up to four tests and

548
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,840
on the other hand okay from here we

549
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,840
could

550
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,799
we could hope that red sample could be

551
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,000
some kind of analog to archaeological

552
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,679
samples

553
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,039
brown sample problem is probably

554
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:07,039
uh not so good and i like because

555
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,039
no and nobody would see we

556
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,859
[Music]

557
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,000
temperature the measurement

558
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,880
graduating temperature

559
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,080
[Music]

560
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,440
shows that uh red sample shows both

561
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,640
more in tradition what would expect

562
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,159
and also this this maximum at

563
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,760
around 100 cannon could be related to

564
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,919
absolute phase

565
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,799
on the other hand low temperature curves

566
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,050
are

567
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,799
nearly featureless so if you

568
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,960
[Applause]

569
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,480
inspect them closely you'll see some

570
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,679
plateau around 100 and some kind of

571
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,559
transition signal some kind of signature

572
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,760
for

573
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,480
transition but nothing else brown sample

574
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,760
is

575
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,880
absolutely crazy and i don't i still

576
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,520
don't know if it's

577
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,399
the instrumental artifact or not but

578
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,200
just to

579
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:15,360
i'm showing just to for uh

580
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:19,360
to account for this to account for this

581
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:24,559
for this particular experiment okay

582
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:28,840
now uh we can also compare the

583
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,880
results of our archaeology magnetic

584
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,159
samples

585
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,360
directly with no with known

586
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,279
data for for statistics using the

587
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,840
hysteresis measurements at graduate

588
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:46,799
temperature we did that for uh

589
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:50,000
for a few samples and for all of them

590
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,159
we see just a monotonous decrease of

591
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,120
coarsivity between five kelvin and true

592
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,120
temperature nothing

593
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:03,600
no collapse of high speed and also the

594
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,960
the remnants uh deduced from

595
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,760
customers slope follows very closely the

596
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,840
dk curves of the of the raman is given

597
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,080
at

598
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,080
1.8 tesla so

599
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,159
there there seem to be quite a

600
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,360
discordance between

601
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,399
the observations done on synthetic

602
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,080
epsilon

603
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:34,399
epsilon iron oxide and on

604
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,780
ceramic ceramic samples respectively

605
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,520
one possible way to

606
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:41,840
[Music]

607
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,840
resolve it to to

608
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,399
bring this this data to close

609
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,640
to closer agreement is to suppose that

610
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,640
uh

611
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,520
epsilon facing the

612
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
archaeological samples is i finally

613
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,279
substituted

614
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,559
this battle but this of course needs

615
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,720
further

616
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,919
investigation now much look for epsilon

617
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,760
phase and

618
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:17,039
we are getting back to magnetite and um

619
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,919
just maybe one month ago i would i would

620
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,000
say magnetite is never observed in

621
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,000
archaeological circles but

622
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,679
never say never recently they started a

623
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,559
few a few samples from

624
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,679
ireland page sites in bulgaria and they

625
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,840
are

626
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:40,559
they showed quite nice the retransition

627
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,840
the doubled one even in this case and

628
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,399
also

629
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,360
interesting thing about this to say

630
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,200
these two samples

631
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,840
is that gca curve runs

632
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,399
higher than fc which is a which is

633
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,399
obviously

634
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,640
an indicator of a rather large grain

635
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,600
size of magnetite in this particular

636
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,840
cell

637
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,940
this particular sample and that that

638
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,440
magnetite

639
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,760
[Music]

640
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,279
to me it's not very likely that it could

641
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,440
fall in city and

642
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,440
it could be inherited from

643
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,240
from the starting the

644
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,720
starting material for this source right

645
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:30,080
so i i would conclude also on the

646
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,640
few takeaways as a

647
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:38,080
just following the following this stream

648
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,840
and um the main the major problem about

649
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,880
the the magnetic meteorology of

650
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,000
archaeological artifacts is either

651
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:53,120
origin is the identity of the

652
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,679
hcslt phase and the comparison between

653
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,039
the

654
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,799
properties of archaeological samples and

655
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,840
the properties of synthetic epsilon

656
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,440
oxide shows that

657
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,080
these properties are quite dissimilar

658
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,080
and particularly particularly cryogenic

659
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,640
temperatures

660
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:18,960
and um

661
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:22,000
probably one possible

662
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,080
possible explanation would be to

663
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,240
allow for some metal substitution

664
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,240
in natural samples but but again

665
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,399
that has to be studied experimentally

666
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,240
this absolutely has to be studied

667
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,320
experiment

668
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,360
uh second uh

669
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,399
related to this hcs

670
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,360
is that in the light of uh

671
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,640
discovery of uh garcia muniz and others

672
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,200
can it carry

673
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,360
remains above the temperature of its

674
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,399
airplane disappears from the record

675
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,320
and does it really disappear

676
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,200
that shall also need to be

677
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,840
[Music]

678
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,440
that does also need to be seen in the

679
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,760
future

680
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,159
and uh i still insist that

681
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,640
stoichiometric magnetite seldom because

682
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,399
in

683
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:22,960
syringes and baked clay

684
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,360
and on the other hand if it's still

685
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,159
if it's still found in some samples it

686
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,039
can be

687
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,150
can be used this is an inference for

688
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,480
some particular conditions of

689
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,360
[Music]

690
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,360
these samples and

691
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,159
have seen in the past so thank you very

692
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,279
much for your attention

693
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,760
yep i think i'll stop here

694
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,640
thank you very much thank you very much

695
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,960
thank you

696
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:55,279
uh let's give a big round of applause

697
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:59,039
to andre thank you very much um

698
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,039
we are now open for questions

699
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:07,840
um if you want you can drop a question

700
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,840
in the chat or you can ask yourself

701
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,419
[Music]

702
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,639
some questions

703
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,440
so i guess the i will i will start with

704
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,280
the

705
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,919
with the curiosity oh so

706
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,839
that the late the last slide was really

707
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,879
interesting because it summed up

708
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,079
really what what you did so far do you

709
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,119
plan to

710
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,079
uh to to

711
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,720
uh deepen the study of this epsilon

712
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,720
magnetite

713
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,190
you cannot mute yourself yes yeah yeah i

714
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,359
do

715
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,040
[Music]

716
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,639
well this uh this synthetic samples are

717
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,320
shown

718
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,680
obtained just within last few weeks

719
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,760
and so of course we well

720
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,160
one idea is to start to add some

721
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,160
metals apart from iron to this uh

722
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,280
synthesis

723
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,400
and i didn't tell i didn't tell that

724
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,240
in the presentation but this um

725
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,680
in the material science they add some

726
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:28,079
alkali earth to earth

727
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:31,440
most often barium just to

728
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,359
produce the

729
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,920
pausing this pause in the situation

730
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,800
which are exactly of the

731
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,359
size of the stability of epsilon phase

732
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,599
and

733
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:46,880
by this and it's by this method they

734
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,000
obtain the particles that are very

735
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,079
perfect in shape and you have the

736
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,520
course evidence in excess of two tests

737
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,040
now good test

738
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,320
but in natural samples i think that

739
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,599
we can we cannot exclude that uh we have

740
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,720
we could have some

741
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,839
cancer or magnesium

742
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,200
you know in our rocks and uh i'm

743
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,520
wondering if

744
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,480
this this light outer layers

745
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,920
methods metals could uh work in the

746
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,560
similar way

747
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,560
another thing is that just

748
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,520
we have we have several uh candidates

749
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,720
mental candidates for uh

750
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,560
which could substitute irons and

751
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,800
it's as yet it's

752
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,240
not known what would happen with these

753
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,680
particular metals

754
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,440
there are once again in materials

755
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,200
they they use the substitutions for

756
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,400
completely different purposes

757
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,800
and not with matters we would like to

758
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
them to study particularly not with

759
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,440
titanium

760
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,320
and but but in the recent study

761
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:13,040
the in the recent study

762
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,040
team for a team spanish team that

763
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,480
discovered the high temperature phase of

764
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,520
epsilon oxide

765
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,320
did they did the same using the chromium

766
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,200
substitute

767
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,920
the epsilon phase and the transition

768
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,680
temperature

769
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,400
unexpectedly goes down which is

770
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,400
which is fine

771
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,520
which we would have hoped for and also

772
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,079
but the

773
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,240
but the high temperature phase also

774
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,240
exists in this substitute that

775
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:48,480
absolute oxide as well so it's um

776
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:52,160
so it's a quite

777
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,800
rich field for further study yes

778
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,520
yeah with important implications for

779
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,320
sure

780
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,040
greg here the question i do have a

781
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,680
question but

782
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,680
uh despina has has one as well so we'll

783
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,680
let we'll let her ask first

784
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,200
sorry i didn't see the hand raised i

785
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,160
apologize the spinner

786
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,880
uh and don't apologize because i'm very

787
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,920
bad in

788
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,040
uh in all this stuff so um

789
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
my question to andre is first only this

790
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,839
research is very

791
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,599
interesting and i read your paper

792
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,839
yesterday so i have a

793
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,359
let's say an overall view but what i

794
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,560
would like to ask you

795
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,280
is uh very elementary about the choice

796
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,320
of your

797
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,560
uh collections i mean you choose one

798
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,960
collection from bulgaria

799
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,760
and one from russia the first one is

800
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,160
mostly

801
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,800
uh neolithic with a couple of roman

802
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,280
bricks

803
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,640
the second one is medieval bricks from

804
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,560
russia

805
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,200
and then it seems that there are

806
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,000
differences between these groups

807
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,880
can can you tell us a few words uh i

808
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,760
mean this is a

809
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,320
difference it cannot be geographical so

810
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,400
the

811
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,040
is the environment from where these

812
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,079
collections come which is different

813
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,320
or what i would very much like to

814
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,240
to have an answer to that maybe through

815
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,680
an email i mean you don't need to

816
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,200
reply now yeah well that's

817
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,760
a very good question yeah and

818
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
but uh

819
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,240
well we uh yeah we worked primarily

820
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,079
with bulgarian samples just because they

821
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,119
they were this is probably the

822
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,599
best collection around the world

823
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,480
i cannot hear you andre i cannot wait

824
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,240
i'm so i'm

825
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,200
i'm so i'm sorry i'm trying to suggest

826
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,880
much better it's better yeah great okay

827
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,160
the bulgarian collection is

828
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,160
uh obviously one uh probably the

829
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,200
the the best available collection yes

830
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,599
10 years old 20 years or 50 years yes

831
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,760
yeah and just uh

832
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,079
russian samples were included because

833
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,599
they we did see

834
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,400
some interesting interesting difference

835
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,760
between the burger and russian samples

836
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,839
particularly

837
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:34,160
those two that have uh those two that

838
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:36,480
have the this hc salty place have it

839
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
the properties is a little bit different

840
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,040
that temperature at which

841
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,250
that this phase disappears from the okay

842
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,280
the disappearance is

843
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:48,000
[Music]

844
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,599
maybe as low as 120 or 140 degrees

845
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,839
centigrade which is lower than in

846
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,200
bulgarian samples

847
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,640
there was also some few samples from

848
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,520
novgorod which

849
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,880
did which have seen when we saw them

850
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,880
[Music]

851
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,680
both epsilon was hclp base

852
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,079
and domina but they were dominately

853
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,780
dominated by hematite

854
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,480
so so we tried to

855
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:21,040
[Music]

856
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,560
find more as much as different samples

857
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,680
as we could simply

858
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,880
because well i think one two 120 is

859
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,440
probably the lowest

860
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,240
temperature the lowest temperature at

861
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,280
which this

862
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,560
uh slt

863
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,440
acs ultra phase disappears

864
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,480
ever reported so basically the reason

865
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,200
was that

866
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:48,240
yeah thank you why why there are so much

867
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,319
and to me the difference those

868
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,760
differences are quite big

869
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,480
and but we still don't have clear

870
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,400
answer or why maybe i will contact you

871
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,640
through an email because i have maybe

872
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,440
a couple of other questions but not now

873
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,400
thank you andrei

874
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,839
thanks a lot thanks magnet for starting

875
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,920
collaborations

876
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,680
we see that coming yeah that would be

877
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,480
great yeah

878
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,920
so um thank you thank you so bruce has a

879
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,040
question as well

880
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:22,160
raised hand andre uh interesting

881
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,760
interesting talk you know that epsilon

882
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,160
phase

883
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,200
must be related to the actual clay

884
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,720
composition

885
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,640
in the original pot that got fired

886
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,599
and that epsilon phase seems to form

887
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,400
from iron rich smectite clays

888
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,040
for the dehydration of those clays at

889
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,040
high temperature

890
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,160
where probably not titania but aluminum

891
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,400
calcium

892
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:54,319
uh might be more important

893
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:59,040
iron substitution of that yeah

894
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:02,720
yeah we have to look into it

895
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,079
yeah because unfortunately

896
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,280
the problem is that the claims also are

897
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,560
not always known

898
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,960
for archaeological uh

899
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,160
artifact particularly for more ancient

900
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,160
ones so

901
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,160
right it might be a problem

902
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,520
that's uh that could be uh that was

903
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,520
that is what you could look into using

904
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,040
this russian collection because

905
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,800
particularly this year's level

906
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,240
collection it comes from

907
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,480
[Music]

908
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:39,760
churches which were erected between

909
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,000
in 18th century mostly and so in the in

910
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,599
this

911
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,880
case we can try to track the

912
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,880
sources from docking so it might be

913
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,520
it's good it's a good idea good thing to

914
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,720
do

915
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,760
and we'll try to we'll try that yeah

916
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,040
i know your paper there that you you hit

917
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,359
the non-tonight

918
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,720
and uh ended up with something similar

919
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,839
yeah yeah that yeah that was 35 years

920
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,680
back we saw progress i know that but

921
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,680
well and uh yet another

922
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,880
there was yet another study in materials

923
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,940
that also he

924
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,359
known tonight and ended up and

925
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,640
[Music]

926
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,040
obtained also absolute like phrase

927
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,839
but unfortunately no magnetics was done

928
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,800
on that

929
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,520
but uh that that has to be investigated

930
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,119
yes

931
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,119
yeah thanks you

932
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,440
thank you thank you anybody else with a

933
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,200
question i can't see all

934
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:50,880
all of you but uh you cannot mute

935
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:54,000
yourself you you do have a question

936
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,000
greg do you have a question

937
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,319
um yeah so i guess my kind of question

938
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,720
is is how

939
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,480
might you expect this so you describe

940
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,240
the epsilon phase as having

941
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,680
an apparent curing temperature which is

942
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,359
maybe related to to

943
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,880
a change in the phase um how

944
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,720
might you expect that to manifest in

945
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,160
a remnants experiment like a paleo

946
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,359
intensity experiment for example

947
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,480
well i would rather hope

948
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:27,280
it would not have a great effect because

949
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,480
the high temperature phase of high

950
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,359
temperature epsilon

951
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,680
is much weaker than the low temperature

952
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,359
and

953
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,359
hopefully it wouldn't be

954
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,880
in the reals in the real samples i

955
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,160
i would believe it would not be

956
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,280
distinguishable from

957
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,839
make hematite or hematite

958
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,520
because the conservative range would be

959
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,240
approximately the same

960
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,960
but it would be it would be curious to

961
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,400
investigate that in

962
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:02,160
in synthetics well there was a

963
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,160
recently the uh

964
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,240
the same spanish group that that i

965
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,110
mentioned

966
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,359

1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,319
um our our next talk is going to be

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,720
uh from simon on the first

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,720
intensity data from neoproterozoid

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,080
implications

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,920
hi okay can everyone hear me

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920
yeah i hope so

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,840
okay can anyone hear me yes there's no

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,880
problem

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,040
[Music]

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,640
yeah okay thanks so hi i'm simon lloyd

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,320
from the university of liverpool

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
and i'm presenting the first paleo

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
intensity data to come from the

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,160
cryogenian

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,480
and discussing their potential

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,719
implications for inner core nucleation

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,719
age

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,360
and so the aim of the study was to help

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
reduce the large uncertainty in the

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,440
estimates

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,000
for inner core nucleation age and we

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
want to do

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
this because not only is the formation

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,400
of the inner core

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
a significant event in earth history but

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
also knowledge of when it occurred

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,439
providing valuable constraints on models

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,840
which

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,840
aim to solve other deep earth problems

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
and so we can do this with paleo

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,200
intensity we believe because the

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
formation of the inner core brought

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,119
about two new power sources

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
to help drive the geodynamo

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,400
compositional convection

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,799
and the subsequent release of latent

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
heat and so we'd expect to see an

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
increase in

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
intensity observations at earth's

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
surface

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,119
and or a change in the time average

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,799
morphology of the field

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,560
and so if we look at models the most

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,439
recent models to

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,880
predict age estimates we've got

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,320
observational based models

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,439
such as those on the left and geodynamo

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,520
models on the right

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,119
and we can see that the age estimates

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,240
here span more than 500 million years

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,640
but that they all fall in or around the

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,640
neoproterozoic era

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,440
and so far it's been difficult to link

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,120
paleomagnetic observational data

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,599
and the outputs from geodynamo

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
simulations however this has been a key

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,440
aim of the deep group

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
at liverpool over the last few years and

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,879
there's some exciting new papers to come

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,200
out of this research

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,879
an important caveat though is that

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,720
despite significant advances in

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,800
geodynamo simulations

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,480
estimates remain based on uncertain

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
parameters such as thermal conductivity

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
and so this is why paleo intensity

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,000
observations are vital as a constraint

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,800
on these models and so if we look at the

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
neoproterozoic in more detail

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
this cartoon represents geological

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,720
history

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
from 4.6 billion years ago clockwise to

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,800
the present day

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,319
and we've highlighted the neoproterozoic

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,959
and if we now populate this with

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,480
all the current paleo intensity data we

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
have

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,080
we see that there's just four single

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
data points in almost 500 years

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
million years of earth history and for

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,959
context these have been

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,680
plotted in relation to the present air

83
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
field

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,200
where the surface of the earth there

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,959
would be no feel at all

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
but the takeaway message from this is

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
that the most recent age estimates

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,720
coincide

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,920
with the severe porosity of data in the

90
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,159
neoproterozoic

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,080
and so that's what this study aims to

92
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
help with

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,159
by looking at rocks from high up to

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,680
canada and greenland

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,680
so if we zoom in on that area

96
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
we've been looking at rocks from the

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,000
franklin large igneous province

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,200
an event which took place around 720

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,239
million years ago

100
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
and covered a vast area almost well over

101
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,480
two million

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,200
square kilometers including dikes sills

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
volcanics and intrusives however we're

104
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,959
focused mainly on

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,400
dikes from elsmere island devon island

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,799
and greenland

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,959
and this is based off previous work by

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,360
denis natal in 2009

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,720
who sampled almost 30 dollar eight dikes

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
and two sills

111
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,239
and they obtained uranium lead aegis

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,879
from the same rocks as they acquired

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,519
primary remnants from

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,359
and the directions of the franklin event

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,040
are well defined across an expansive

116
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,280
area

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
they include reverse polarity directions

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,720
and a positive bait contact test

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
and so this is all important

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
prerequisites to pay

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,280
intensity reliability and this study

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,840
focuses on 16 dollar 8 dikes and 1 sill

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,479
and we obtained 120 of the original

124
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
1-inch

125
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,199
samples which we then cut in half to

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,880
produce 240 half inch samples

127
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,800
so we started off by measuring the rock

128
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,040
magnetic properties of representative

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,880
samples from each of the sites

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,720
we measured hysteresis loops high

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,680
temperature susceptibility

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
magnetization saturation and isothermal

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,960
remnant magnetization

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,600
and we also did a viscous remnant

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,840
magnetization experiment

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
in which we oriented the samples in

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,520
different positions in the earth's field

138
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,759
and from that we were able to measure

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,639
the viscous component

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,080
and then we separated our sites

141
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,320
according to highly low viscous

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,160
component

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,440
we also did some limited scanning

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,120
electron microscopy

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,560
and here if we look at the top two

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,800
images we see

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,479
very fine low titanium titanium

148
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,320
magnetite grains which appear pristine

149
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,160
compared to the bottom two images where

150
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,720
we see much larger grains

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,400
with illuminate and low titanomagnetite

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
with evidence of alteration

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,720
and so if we look at the rock magnetic

154
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,560
results in the top left we have a day

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,280
plot where we can see that most of the

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,080
sites

157
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,560
fall in the psd or vortex above the main

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,759
state

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,319
region and next to that we see

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
our mst curves which we separated

161
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,759
according to

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,600
reversibility at room temperature

163
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
however these tell us that

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,120
we have a single curry temperature

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,240
ranging from 550 to 590 degrees celsius

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,080
which we interpret as low titanium

167
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,240
titanomagnetite

168
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,919
and we see a range of reversibility in

169
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
the kt curves

170
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,120
so the top row of kt curves are the more

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,000
reversible

172
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,720
and the bottom row are less reversible

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
and we also

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,080
see evidence of low temperature

175
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,680
inflections at around 300 degrees c

176
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,160
and so we took a multi-technique

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,639
approach to gathering paleo intensity

178
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,919
results we used three methods the

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,600
thermal talia method

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,600
the microwave method and the sure double

181
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,880
heating technique with and without

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,720
low temperature demagnetization and the

183
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
success rates are next to the methods

184
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,319
there and we see that the thermal

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,960
italian method didn't do so well

186
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,319
predominantly due to failure of ptrm

187
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319
checks due to alteration

188
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,240
and so the big feature from our results

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
is that the

190
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,960
field was extremely weak at this time

191
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,479
almost an order of magnitude weaker than

192
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
today

193
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,000
and so we got we used we got results

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,039
from three methods

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,759
almost 40 results from 11 sites

196
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,000
however four of the sites had less than

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,240
three years so we don't use these

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,440
in our calculation of virtual dipole

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
moments

200
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,680
you also note we get a low sight mean

201
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,880
standard deviation in absolute terms of

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,960
less than three microteslas

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
and if we look at some of the array

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,199
plots

205
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,919
here each column represents a different

206
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,039
method

207
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,000
and each row is that is represents

208
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,199
uh the same site so in this way we're

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,919
able to compare

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,520
sister specimens across method and we

211
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,960
can see that we get consistent results

212
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,360
in absolute terms

213
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,479
within and between sites and from all

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,919
three methods

215
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,840
for example the bottom row site bp

216
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:07,840
we get 5.3 microteslas 6.7

217
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,039
and 7.4 each from a different method

218
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,400
and we can also see that there are some

219
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,039
two slope array plots

220
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,800
present however a change in slope

221
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,759
usually corresponds to a change in

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
direction

223
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
and that's most notable in the top

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,160
middle

225
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,160
array plot

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,840
so we also compare our rock magnetic

227
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,240
results on our paleo intensity results

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,919
and we found these in good agreement

229
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,680
because

230
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,760
all sites which show high viscous

231
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,599
components we get no paleo intensity

232
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,120
results for

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,120
and the less reversible kt caves and or

234
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,440
low temperature inflections we also get

235
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,440
no paleo intensity results for

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,360
and so the successful paleo intensity

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
results are associated with

238
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,480
sites displaying the highest quality

239
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
rock magnetic properties

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,440
we also look at the potential for

241
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,440
any bias from multi-domain effects and

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
we do this because of the two slope

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,839
array plots and also

244
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,959
the psd domain

245
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,519
state properties and so we do this by

246
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
comparing sure low temperature

247
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,519
demagnetization results with those that

248
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
did not

249
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,240
undergo any ltd and that's because ltd

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,040
is said to remove

251
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,959
preferentially remove md-like remnants

252
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,320
so if we look at the plot

253
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,399
in the bottom left we've got sister

254
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
samples from six different sites where

255
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,800
the

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
blue columns are the ltd and the orange

257
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
columns are no ltd

258
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,320
and we see that the results are almost

259
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,399
equivalent so this suggests that we

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,000
don't have any bias from md

261
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,399
effects we also

262
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
looked at the two slope array plots uh

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,920
particularly where a change in direction

264
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,880
was less obvious

265
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,800
and we changed the best line fit

266
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,320
considerably and we found that a large

267
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
change in slope

268
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
actually corresponds to a very small

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
absolute change in

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,240
intensity so if there is any effect from

271
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,240
md we think it's minimal

272
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,560
we also scored our results using the qpi

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,079
system

274
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,839
from biggin and patterson 2014 and our

275
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
site score between five and nine

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,279
and so if we look at our results and

277
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,040
compare them with

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,600
uh current global data our results are

279
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,560
in

280
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,880
are the uh green squares and we've

281
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
selected data here with a qpi score of

282
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,720
three or more

283
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,240
and an n of three or more and some

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,240
observations we can make from this

285
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,399
uh but firstly it's important to note

286
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,240
the precambrian studies may not be

287
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
representative of the very long term

288
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,200
average

289
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,640
because they may capture a temporarily

290
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,160
or spatially limited anomaly

291
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,160
however we've produced seven vdms

292
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,519
from four to nineteen zero meters

293
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
squared

294
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,880
which are consistent with an inner core

295
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,399
that had yet to form

296
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,839
however we know that severe porosity of

297
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,079
um intensity data remains

298
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,920
we can also see that our new data fit

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,959
well on the polynomial fit provided by

300
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,000
bono ital

301
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,040
in 2019 which is highlighted as the

302
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
dashed orange line

303
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,200
and we also noted that our data our

304
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,200
results support low field observations

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
prior to the onset of three phanerozoic

306
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,720
supercroms

307
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,480
suggesting a possible quasi periodicity

308
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,000
in dipole strength

309
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,480
and we can see that in this image

310
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,440
where you can you can see that there are

311
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,720
there are

312
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,920
lows preceding each of the three super

313
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,600
cons in the phanerozoic

314
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
and so in summary we've reported the

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,320
first paleo intensity results in a mid

316
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,200
neoproterosaric 300 million year gap

317
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,000
in global records and our results are

318
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,079
consistent

319
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,600
within and between site and method

320
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,920
ranging from one to ten microteslas

321
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,639
seven vdms are determined ranging from

322
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,000
four to nineteen zero meters squared

323
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,240
and that's compared to the presence

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
airfield of around 80 zero meters

325
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,880
squared

326
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,880
and they're associated with high qpi

327
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,360
scores between five and nine

328
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,480
and although many more reliable paleo

329
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,920
intensity data

330
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,639
are needed for a more meaningful

331
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,760
analysis these new data are consistent

332
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,760
with an inner core that had yet to form

333
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,079
that's it thanks it's probably quite

334
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,079
short

335
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,959
okay uh thanks very much for your talk

336
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,040
that was very interesting

337
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,519
uh oh my camera's up there there we go

338
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
um yeah that's great thanks very much uh

339
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,000
i i have a quick

340
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,440
i haven't seen if anyone else has any

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,959
questions i'll ask them in a minute but

342
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,839
i have a question for you

343
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,240
um have you compared the work you've

344
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,079
done

345
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,639
to or have you come across the work of

346
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,720
roman uh

347
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,279
velvsky in um

348
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
he's in moscow state in obviously in

349
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,000
russia

350
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,320
and he's been working on the on the cola

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,519
peninsula for the last several years

352
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,120
um and i know that the age range of

353
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,920
intrusions that he has quite a lot of

354
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,200
pmag data collected from covers the

355
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,320
interval that you're describing here

356
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,240
and it might be an interesting

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,760
comparison

358
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,720
yeah i mean it doesn't ring a bell to me

359
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,160
now because

360
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,519
the only data i know of that's published

361
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,720
is the stuff i've just

362
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,160
shown yeah like i'm not sure if it is

363
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,760
the exact

364
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,680
you know the exact same ages but it

365
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,480
certainly is

366
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,920
it certainly is flanking or the range

367
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
that he's working in is

368
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,519
beyond the rig you know covers the range

369
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
that you're in as well

370
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,839
so you might be um quite a friendly guy

371
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,519
like it might be a good idea to

372
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,279
see if you can touch base and i have

373
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,720
this presentation from egu

374
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,880
uh last year if you want to have a look

375
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,279
at it yeah later on i'll send it your

376
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,880
way

377
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,240
thanks bill um sorry i should have asked

378
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,720
does anyone else have any other

379
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
questions

380
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,519
no okay that's that's fair enough

381
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
um thank you very much ask the question

382
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,720
sorry

383
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,760
yeah richard go ahead yeah

384
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,600
so i was just wondering what the latest

385
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,079
uh state of play is on on whether or not

386
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,440
the formation of the inner core really

387
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,560
does increase the intensity

388
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,920
dramatically or does it you know to what

389
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,279
extent do we know for sure

390
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,079
that you will see a an increase in

391
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,000
intensity

392
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,839
of the field when the inner core starts

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,720
to form because i know that

394
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,040
you know the model is slightly unsure

395
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,320
which

396
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,320
you know some modelers say it goes one

397
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:56,720
way some say it goes the other way

398
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:00,560
yeah i i think it's still not um

399
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,480
100 certain because

400
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,920
i mean i think generally the consensus

401
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,519
is that you would see an increase in

402
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,279
intensity

403
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,360
certainly a change in the morphology of

404
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,480
the field um

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,160
yeah so it's it's not um

406
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,399
it's not been decided that one i don't

407
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,399
think

408
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,360
but you guess it's it's because it is

409
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,399
it's more certain is it that you would

410
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,320
you would see a low

411
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:32,160
field prior just prior to it is it

412
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,079
and that seems yeah yes

413
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,519
especially we're performing and in the

414
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,040
core form and so late

415
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,839
so the thermal strength has decreased so

416
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,839
much

1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,600
um

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
hi everybody um thank you all very much

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,280
for

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,400
um joining us for the um first

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,799
uh magnet seminar of 2021

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,480
and the series that we ran last year was

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,560
was very successful

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
and it was really great to see uh so

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,400
many people

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,680
uh still coming in already we're over 17

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
still counting

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,840
so it's really fantastic that we've got

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
so many people here

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,199
supporting our community um through some

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
sort of

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,360
challenging times that we're all facing

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,480
um

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,719
so just a quick um note for for people

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
who

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,800
haven't actually attended these seminars

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,840
we've got a few new faces

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,120
um joining us now um these seminars are

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,480
typically on the order for

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,239
25 to um 30 minutes long we have a

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,039
little bit of flexibility because i know

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,840
lisa is gone for a slightly longer talk

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
but

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,719
we'll squeeze we'll squeeze it in um but

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,840
can i just ask that everybody

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,960
um please keep your microphones muted um

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
while the presenter is is speaking um

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
and if you're struggling with internet

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
connection

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,320
um if you turn your mic your video off

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
and that can often

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,439
um improve some of the speed um at the

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,600
end of the seminar we'll have a 10 or

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,560
15 minute chance for for questions and

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
discussion

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
um you can either raise your hand and

41
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
ask an

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
oral question or you can type in into

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,079
the chat window

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,360
and one of us most likely myself will

45
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,799
read out the question

46
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,439
um for you and just a reminder that you

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,320
know

48
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,600
we all have life going on around us in

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,320
the background so

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,360
if you have to to to go halfway through

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,759
these seminars

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
and just go we all know what it's like

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,960
uh working from home

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
or up early in the morning and all sorts

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,560
of things going on that doesn't apply to

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,560
you lisa you're here for the duration

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,320
i'm afraid um

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
and at the end of the seminar we'll have

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,719
a chance uh for a bit of a catch-up

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,759
because we're all um spread around the

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,119
world not really

62
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,040
interacting with each other in the same

63
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,360
ways that we used to so there'll be time

64
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,680
for

65
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
a catch a catch up on a chat uh later on

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
at the end

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,760
and that part of the seminar is not

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,120
going to be recorded so it's it's it's

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,400
um uh a bit more relaxed

70
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,480
um and so our speaker for today um is

71
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,840
lisa talks i'm really grateful for her

72
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,920
for

73
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,440
speaking today for our first seminar of

74
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
2021

75
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,800
and today she'll be talking about

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
understanding non-ideal

77
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
paleointensity recorders in igneous

78
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,400
rocks

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,400
so i will hand over to you lisa okay can

80
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,680
i share my screen

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,920
yep okay

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
um

83
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,480
[Music]

84
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:55,280
if this works

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,280
can y'all see that yeah that's perfect

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,599
uh i think i shared the wrong screen

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,120
uh um do you have it in present review

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,120
yeah just a minute

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,560
um so let me share

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,840
this screen

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
how's that can you see that or do you

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,599
see two slides or one slide

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,120
uh we see one slide okay great

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,000
okay so the talk today um uh

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,040
is with my uh collaborators Christeanne

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,799
Santos

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
uh Brendan Cych uh Andrew Roberts

98
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,640
Les

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,080
Nagy and Wynn Williams was the paper

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,560
and um and so

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,239
i just i'm going to launch in without

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
you know skipping all the jokes in the

103
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,879
beginning

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,040
and uh talk about i mean mostly

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,319
people in paleomagnetism understand that

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
the basic

107
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
laws of the paleointensity experiment

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
are

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,599
that remanence is blocked at the same

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,640
temperature at which it's unblocked

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,640
that partial remanences that are blocked

112
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,479
between two temperatures are independent

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,919
of all the others

114
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:23,040
and that the sum of the TRM

115
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,240
acquired through a bunch of steps of

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,680
pTRM acquisition would be the same as

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,800
the total TRM and

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,800
when these laws are obeyed you have an

119
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,720
unblocking temperature spectrum and a

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
blocking temperature spectrum

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
there's a little tiny red line inside

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
the blue line and so the blocking and

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,240
unblocking are the same

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,240
then we do this experiment

125
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,280
which is a Koernigsberger Thellier-Thellier

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
type experiment

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
but we do it in a particular way where

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
we alternate in

129
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
field steps and out of field steps and

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
this slide just kind of summarizes the

131
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
experiment

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,479
and then if you plot the magnetization

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
remaining against the magnetization

134
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
acquired at each step you get a straight

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,960
line

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,039
the slope of which is proportional to

137
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,800
the field so that's great

138
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:20,400
now what happens if the two if we

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,199
no longer have reciprocity so

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
the blocking temperature is higher

141
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,160
blocking temperature

142
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
spectrum is higher than the unblocking

143
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,360
temperature spectrum

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,800
in this case you'll get a downward bowed

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,280
arai plot

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,120
on the right that's a the plot the

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,919
remanence remaining against the remanence

148
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
gained

149
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,360
and it sags below the line now

150
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,000
i'm glad to see that Dunlop and Ozdemir are

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,520
here because this was a great paper

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,880
um you have um the

153
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,039
you give it a they gave remanence to

154
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,560
um uh by cooling in a field between 370

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,600
and 350

156
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,400
and then demagnetized that remanence

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,240
and found that much a lot of the

158
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,440
remanence started to decay

159
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,919
well below the blocking temperature

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,880
giving rise to something we call low

161
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,240
temperature

162
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,280
tails pTRM tails and

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,199
and some of it remained um after

164
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,960
the blocking temperature which are high

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,880
temperature tails

166
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,600
and they did ery they did um

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,240
uh paleointensity experiments on them and

168
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,240
plotted

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,520
something that looked a lot like an Arai

170
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,639
plot

171
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:43,120
um where you can see that

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:47,280
all the the coarser grains

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,960
the purple plus signs at 135 microns

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,000
gives significantly saggy

175
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,840
um Arai plots whereas as

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,160
the grain size gets smaller and smaller

177
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,560
you get straighter Arai plots

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
and i didn't notice for a long time but

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,400
that the

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,680
the x-axis was normalized by the total

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,800
trm

182
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,120
on the x-axis and the y-axis

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
was normalized by the original remnants

184
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
and so

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
i thought from this diagram that you

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
could just take the total trm and get

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,720
the right answer

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,680
but that may not be true as was um

189
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,479
uh shown by a few years later by

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,039
cross-eyed all 2003

191
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,039
where if you have very fine-grained

192
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,520
material 60 nanometers

193
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,240
you get the right answer in the lab

194
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,759
field the

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,280
the le these experiments were done in 60

196
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
microtesla lab fields

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,479
and you can see the figure on the left i

198
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,840
don't know if you can see my mouse but

199
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,759
i can't even see my mouse never mind um

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,759
uh the that you get 59.3 you know you

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,039
get the right answer

202
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,360
whereas for larger grain sizes you can

203
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,840
see the one on the right hand side is 12

204
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,840
micron

205
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:13,199
material and it's underestimated by

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:17,199
uh by by hugely it's 42

207
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,560
microtesla instead of 60. and um

208
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,080
and that just seemed to be that the more

209
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,360
curved the Arai plots the worse

210
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,879
the uh total TRM answer or the best fit

211
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,599
line answer was

212
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,519
so is does this happen in nature or is

213
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,680
this only something about these

214
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:42,479
just big synthetic magnetites

215
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:45,200
um so i um

216
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,160
i have been collecting data for a long

217
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
time

218
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,080
and here are uh four examples of four

219
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,279
lava flows

220
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,480
that have specimens in the lava flow

221
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,040
that gave

222
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,880
very nice straight Arai plots that's

223
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,480
the top row

224
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,560
and the bottom row are sister specimens

225
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,600
from the same lava flow

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,920
and you can see that whereas

227
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,320
the one historical lava flow that we

228
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,320
have this hawaii 108

229
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,600
um we know the answer the answer was

230
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,640
a 39

231
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,120
microtesla is the correct answer

232
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,959
this hit the arai plot from the straight

233
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,800
one got the right answer

234
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,680
um but the sister specimen from the same

235
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,320
flow uh the best fit line and the total

236
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,920
trm

237
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,720
are low by 30 microtesla so very very

238
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,080
wrong

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
extremely low bias and we found that if

240
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,160
you take

241
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,240
uh straight arai plots from lava flows in

242
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,120
general if you compare them to the

243
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
results from

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,279
curved Arai plots from the same lava

245
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,560
flow you tend to get

246
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,160
an underestimate so there is a bias

247
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
associated with

248
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,440
with uh curved Arai plots and it tends

249
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,560
to be

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
that if they're downward sagged

251
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,839
that there's a negative there's a low

252
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,480
bias

253
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,959
and interestingly if there's an upward

254
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,959
bow

255
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,040
it tends to be overestimated

256
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,000
why i don't know and maybe we can figure

257
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,760
this out um

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,160
but um the

259
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:36,399
this so

260
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,360
the um the blue uh

261
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,720
circle is around one particular lava

262
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,320
flow that

263
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,680
we published in 2009

264
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,880
and um we sampled this from Isla Socorro

265
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,000
in the Pacific Ocean

266
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,279
and um and found this and i thought

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,120
because at the time

268
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,120
this was about in 2006.

269
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
we were talking in the community i

270
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
remember having conversations with many

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,240
of you

272
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
um at many meetings about how we should

273
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,519
be comparing unblocking with unblocking

274
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
and not

275
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,680
blocking with unblocking and so on and

276
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,920
so forth so i thought well

277
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,040
why don't i just give this guy a fresh

278
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,480
TRM

279
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,440
and then do it properly but the problem

280
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,040
was

281
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,120
that you can see that this is another

282
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,959
pair another sample from the same lava

283
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,040
flow

284
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,920
that um the Arai plot in the original

285
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
from the original experiment which is um

286
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,160
in the top

287
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,440
diagram was quite curved but

288
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
the uh Arai plot when we gave it a fresh

289
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,120
TRM

290
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,040
in the lab is the lower right hand side

291
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,240
and you can see it's perfectly straight

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,920
so the curvature was not reproducible

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,959
and so therefore any attempt to compare

294
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,279
um the blocking temperature

295
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
in the lab with the or the unblocking

296
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
temperature in the lab with the

297
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
unblocking temperature in the original

298
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,079
would not give

299
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,360
a good result um and i don't i did not

300
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,279
understand

301
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,200
why uh this happened i couldn't

302
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,480
these are a couple hundred thousand year

303
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,399
old lava flows so

304
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:23,200
vrm is not really an option here

305
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:26,560
and um and so i was puzzled

306
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,760
uh and i i now call this behavior

307
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,399
fragile curvature so it's not the same

308
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
thing

309
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,920
that what Dunlop and Ozdemir were

310
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,399
looking at or crossovers

311
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,519
were looking at which is a reproducible

312
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,720
curvature

313
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,600
and that you can maybe compensate for

314
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
because it's reproducible in the lab but

315
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
this

316
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,040
fragile curvature which seems to be

317
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,160
everywhere in natural samples

318
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,600
um particularly lava flows uh

319
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,120
is is a is a bear so

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,120
um how um

321
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,839
um that's that's a a bummer uh

322
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,440
so it started me thinking about this

323
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,240
problem a while ago

324
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:18,839
what causes curvature and Arai plots and

325
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,320
what cause why what causes this fragile

326
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,639
curvature

327
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,560
does this fragile curvature we start out

328
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,760
with a nice straight arai plot does the

329
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,880
fragile curvature

330
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,399
increase with time and are data from

331
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,000
these kinds of

332
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,560
samples biased and is there

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
some hope and it's the remedy part that

334
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,000
i'm probably not going to get to today

335
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,480
because you can see i have way too many

336
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,480
slides

337
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,000
so i i can think right now of of

338
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,079
two sources of curvature

339
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,519
one is the stuff that donal upper nurse

340
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:59,040
number published about

341
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:01,199
and crassa and uh those are domain walls

342
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,000
that produce this curvature the

343
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,440
separation of blocking and unblocking

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,800
and i think that um that

345
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,839
that phenomenon is

346
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,120
pretty well understood maybe not but

347
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,959
um i'm not going to worry about it

348
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
because most of my samples don't have

349
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,120
multi-domain grains

350
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
or big multi-domains but there's this

351
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,120
fragile curvature

352
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,680
which is not reproducible it's caused as

353
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,839
a mystery

354
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
and i think it's a failure of the

355
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,240
additivity test

356
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,279
and through micromagnetic modeling i'm

357
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,399
hoping that

358
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,120
Les nagy and Wyn Williams can help me

359
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,639
figure out

360
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,360
what is going on um

361
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
and um i mean you can you can ima i've

362
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
got

363
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,639
some guesses we've got guesses um and

364
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,680
um it is a serious problem

365
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,600
because i think anything that is

366
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,720
curved right now i would be highly

367
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,920
suspicious of

368
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,079
the result so

369
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,199
in order to investigate this further

370
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,720
char rancher then my postdoc

371
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,800
and i took a bunch of samples that were

372
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
curved curved Arai plots originally gave

373
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,880
them fresh trms they were perfectly

374
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,160
straight

375
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,519
we aged them for two years and the

376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,519
curvature increased

377
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,760
and the results were biased relative to

378
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,720
the lab field so

379
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,199
then Christeanne Santos was a master's

380
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,800
student

381
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,680
in my lab and we added

382
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,320
we decided to do it again this time

383
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,519
taking

384
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,199
what we considered to be ideal specimens

385
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,959
so ones that had straight Arai plots to

386
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,399
begin with

387
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,839
and um give them a fresh TRM

388
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,120
and then do this experiment again

389
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,120
and so we did that and published it in

390
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,480
2019

391
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,440
we came up with several categories of

392
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,440
behavior

393
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,639
and here we used Greig's marvelous

394
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,000
curvature criterion which we just use it

395
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,240
as a way to separate

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,480
things that uh into

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
well-behaved straight Arai plots and

398
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,600
poorly 

399
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,199
behaved curved area plots so it's just a

400
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,399
empirically based um way of separating

401
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,880
things that are

402
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,639
quote unquote good from things that are

403
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,680
quote unquote curved

404
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,880
so we had this behavior where we had

405
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,720
four categories of behavior one

406
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,480
that the original trms in the upper

407
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
left-hand corner were straight

408
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,160
perfectly straight and then when we gave

409
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,399
them a fresh TRM they were perfectly

410
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,160
straight and we call those

411
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,959
straight goes to straight and that's ss

412
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,480
um then we found a bunch that were

413
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,399
straight in the original

414
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,000
where actually it's only one lava flow

415
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
but it's a

416
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
it's a it's kind of over represented

417
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,000
because i thought they were straight

418
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,079
um the straight

419
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,439
uh original Arai plot in the lower

420
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,480
left-hand corner

421
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,880
went to a curved array plot but you can

422
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,360
see it's a particular kind of curvature

423
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
it's got this high temperature hook to

424
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,959
it

425
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
and so that we call the straight goes to

426
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,600
curve i'm not going to focus a lot on

427
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,959
those

428
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,480
and then there was this case which was

429
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,080
in the sparbouri

430
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,679
study where we had a lava flow

431
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:39,360
that gave a curved arai plot and that's

432
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:43,200
on the right hand side top row

433
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,360
and then when we gave them a fresh trm

434
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,280
in the lab they became straight

435
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,640
according to greig's criterion you can

436
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,520
see that it really did straighten out

437
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,840
and that's what i'm calling fragile

438
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,360
curvature

439
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,960
and then there was this set that

440
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:07,440
started out curved um and

441
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,559
um went a lot straighter in the lower

442
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,240
right hand corner

443
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
they're much straighter but they're

444
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,200
still curved according to greig's

445
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,760
criterion so

446
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,280
these are the four categories of

447
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,039
behavior

448
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,520
so then um christeanne and i

449
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,559
and i pulled in some others to help me

450
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,520
on this

451
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,520
who are on the paper

452
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
took sister specimens from each of those

453
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,200
samples

454
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,240
10 sister specimens um unfortunately you

455
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,039
can't do this

456
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,280
study using the same samples over and

457
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,679
over again because we age them for

458
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,200
a couple years and so we'd be here until

459
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,600
um

460
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
the next century probably trying to do

461
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,200
this experiment

462
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,480
so we did it this way and there are

463
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,520
design flaws but

464
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,840
that's just the reality of of

465
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
of how we had to do the experiment so we

466
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,640
took 10

467
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
sister specimens from each of those

468
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
samples that i just

469
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,520
uh told you about

470
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,679
and we uh gave them um

471
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,080
identical uh we we gave them a trm and a

472
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,559
70 microtesla field

473
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,400
then we put them in various orientations

474
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,559
to two different lab fields

475
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,280
so a 70 microtesla lab field parallel to

476
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,000
the remnants

477
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,120
is position one top row so nothing

478
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,360
should happen right

479
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,760
it's it's in its equilibrium happy place

480
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,480
so nothing should change for position

481
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,120
one in 70 microtesla

482
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,160
and we did it at uh in five different

483
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,799
positions

484
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,400
then we also did a set where we aged it

485
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,520
in a lower field of

486
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,559
35 microtesla

487
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,559
same positions and so

488
00:19:52,559 --> 00:20:00,320
we um for the study the tokusat 2021

489
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,679
study we aged them for two years

490
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,000
and um and did some rock mag

491
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,840
on them to try to characterize them i

492
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
did have a whole set of slides to

493
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,280
explain these figures but i'm just gonna

494
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,200
move on on the left hand side most of

495
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,840
you are familiar with the conventional

496
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,720
forc diagrams

497
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,440
so the top one is a conventional forc

498
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,679
diagram

499
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,159
the top left of one of the ss

500
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,080
uh specimens straight their single

501
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,960
domain and they look single domain right

502
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,240
i mean sure they're single domain and

503
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,520
then the sc

504
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:42,960
um the ones that went that had this

505
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,960
hook on them have this pirate hat

506
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,960
um distribution in their conventional

507
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,200
forc

508
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,240
and you can see that the one in the

509
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,240
lower left the

510
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
curved has probably a lot of

511
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,360
multi-domain in there

512
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,400
then we did the remnants forc and

513
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,039
the transient forc and the

514
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,799
induced forc and the one on the right is

515
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,000
this induced forc that

516
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,360
shenzhou came up with um

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
i think it was him it might have been

518
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,039
andy i don't know one of those two

519
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:18,080
um and the induced forc

520
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,200
has has some features and i don't

521
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,280
understand them

522
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,000
yet but the upper right hand

523
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,720
is characteristic of single domain

524
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,159
material

525
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,640
you can see this in magnetic recording

526
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,520
type

527
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,600
you know type section of of single

528
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,559
domain stuff

529
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,960
and um and the lower right hand corner

530
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,240
is

531
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,000
characteristic of multi-domain uh

532
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,159
or multi-axial large um

533
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,240
i mean i think we call them casually

534
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,960
multi-domain but they might be

535
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,919
some of these weird bizarre um

536
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,640
multi-axial vortex states i don't know

537
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,559
um

538
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,559
and you can see that it has this pattern

539
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,000
of negative positive negative positive

540
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,320
negative

541
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,159
positive up at the top right hand side

542
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,320
um and that's characteristic of the

543
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,559
coarsest grains

544
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,559
now these two middle eye forks

545
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,760
have a feature which i haven't seen

546
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,280
described in the literature

547
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,480
yet it's i've called it n plus

548
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,480
so it's a double slope of negative you

549
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,720
don't see it in the coarsest grains you

550
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,520
don't see it in the finest grains

551
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,480
and it's characteristic of a lot of lava

552
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,760
flow

553
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,640
type things um where you get this double

554
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,480
negative

555
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,720
um in the in uh in the zone

556
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:48,559
uh one and three of the i forc

557
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:52,640
and so i interpret this to mean that

558
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:55,840
ss are single domain mostly

559
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,039
and cc is a broad

560
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,200
span of grain sizes between

561
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,000
all the way from super paramagnetic up

562
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,039
to perhaps multi-domain

563
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,039
some multi-domain

564
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,200
and then um the two middle ones

565
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,520
i think are intermediate grain sizes

566
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,640
that span the range from

567
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:22,720
from um uh from

568
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,080
small um up to uh

569
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,960
up to single vortex and and um

570
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,600
and i i don't know any more than that

571
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,520
you guys can make something up

572
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:40,720
so uh the next question is why

573
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:43,200
are curves what causes fragile curvature

574
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,400
its reproducible curvature is in the

575
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,400
multi-domains

576
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,600
state fragile curvature is

577
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
characteristic of these

578
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
medium grain sizes the the ones with the

579
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
n

580
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:59,200
plus what i'm calling a butterfly

581
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,200
uh lobe in the eye forc

582
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,360
and then we'll get to the rest of these

583
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,880
um questions later so

584
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,840
here's my guess that it the the fragile

585
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,400
curvature has something to do

586
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,679
with um i mean the Neel state is you

587
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,000
have two stable

588
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,440
states and it can go from one to the

589
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,480
other there's an energy barrier in

590
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
between

591
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
but there's only two choices left to

592
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
right

593
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,320
and um in Neel theory um

594
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,080
but uh of course uh Wynn and Les have

595
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,039
pointed out that there's many more

596
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,960
states um i mean Wynn was one of the

597
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,320
discoverers of the vortex state in the

598
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,840
beginning

599
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,880
and along with uh Dunlop and

600
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,039
um and my buddy Neil bertram

601
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
but

602
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,440
they discovered that there's these more

603
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
complicated states but that was in the

604
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,279
late

605
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,279
80s um and so now

606
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:01,760
um we know that there's some some

607
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,039
very bizarre states in between the

608
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,480
domain and

609
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:10,320
in between single domain and vortex

610
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,799
and uh that if you have a multiplicity

611
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,799
of choice i call it it's sort of the

612
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,279
tyranny of choice

613
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,679
then you can you can have your blocking

614
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,000
temperature change

615
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,000
without changing the net magnetization

616
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,760
which is another feature that during the

617
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,159
aging process

618
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,080
the NRM did not change at all and yet

619
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,000
you have this growth of

620
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,720
of curvature so this is a a

621
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,600
kind of a weird thing but i think it's

622
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,400
explained by

623
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,640
something on the right hand side and of

624
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
course we need to do a lot more work on

625
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,720
that

626
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,080
um what could be causing it but for now

627
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,400
the key question for me as a practicing

628
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,320
paleomagnetist

629
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,200
is uh does fragile curvature increase

630
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,159
with time and

631
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,159
two are data from curved error plots

632
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,400
generally biased

633
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,400
and is there some way we can get around

634
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,520
this because this is

635
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,720
most of the data in the pint database

636
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,320
i just have to say so it's it is

637
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,240
serious if we want to know anything

638
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,200
about the ancient magnetic field we have

639
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,559
to solve this problem

640
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,000
so does curvature change with time um

641
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,640
on the left you have uh kernel density

642
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,320
estimates

643
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:34,720
of curvature in the fresh trms

644
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,840
from the santos study the the 2019 study

645
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,400
and you can see that even the worst are

646
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,520
uh

647
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,919
less than 0.4 that's still pretty bad

648
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,440
but then when you sit these same or

649
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,120
these sister specimens

650
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,279
in a field for two years

651
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,400
the curvature uh increased

652
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,840
not so much for the finest grain the red

653
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,039
curve there which are the

654
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,400
ss samples but

655
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:08,320
it changed a lot for the

656
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,360
cc and um

657
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,559
um and the um

658
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,240
cs and the sc to some extent

659
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,159
yes so um those the x axes are the same

660
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,720
on both of those plots

661
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,279
and so i can say i think with some

662
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,480
confidence that even over two years

663
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:32,159
the curvature of the Arai plots um

664
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,600
increased significantly and that dotted

665
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,640
line is Greig's

666
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:42,080
cut off for straight on the left of it

667
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,080
and curved on the right

668
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
i hope you can't hear the screaming in

669
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,080
the background it's my grandson enjoying

670
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,279
his breakfast

671
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,960
um so

672
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,679
so this fragile curvature exists

673
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
even within our lifetimes and um and

674
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,919
it's not explained by

675
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,159
by any kind of viscous theory that

676
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,360
involves an al theory so

677
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,320
um the

678
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,120
then the then the critical question is

679
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,279
is what i

680
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,440
said uh true i said in the beginning

681
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,679
i started the talk by saying i think

682
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,279
that things that are downward sagged

683
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,159
are biased low and this is bad

684
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,039
so let's see how these just two-year

685
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,399
aged

686
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,679
uh samples perform

687
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:37,600
so um i lumped all the

688
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:41,520
uh fresh and aged results

689
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,960
the fresh results from the santos 2019

690
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,159
paper are the blue line

691
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,520
the kernel density estimate for the

692
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,320
the blue line is clearly the lab field

693
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,880
was 70

694
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,919
as i said and you can see that there is

695
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,760
a bias

696
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,760
to lower fields you might say well it's

697
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,440
only five microtesla lisa

698
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,080
don't worry about it but i said this is

699
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,679
only two years come on

700
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:13,120
and if you if you take from those

701
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:15,200
data only the things that are curved

702
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,200
you get the solid blue line which is

703
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,360
clearly biased and the solid red line

704
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,559
which is also biased

705
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,720
and if you take the straight uh eri

706
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,159
plots from that same data set

707
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,720
and do the same thing you can see

708
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,679
they're not biased

709
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,320
so there does seem to be a slight bias

710
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,360
associated with

711
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,360
curved arrow plots

712
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:45,120
and um so now um

713
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,159
do i have time to keep going greg

714
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,880
yeah yeah you can go on for another few

715
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,440
more minutes

716
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,559
so so now we get to well what do we do

717
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,679
about it

718
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,200
um and here are some ideas whoops

719
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,320
um you could do ltd shaw method

720
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,559
which is supposed to knock out the

721
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,200
multi-domain contribution

722
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,039
and yuji yamamoto i gave him one of the

723
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,159
sets of samples which had been

724
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,200
aged at the time i think four years

725
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,240
and his method i can he's

726
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,679
writing up the paper i think but

727
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,240
basically what

728
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,200
the way he does it now is he'll reject

729
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,760
the same

730
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
samples that i do if i use greg

731
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,480
patterson's

732
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,240
curvature criterion to say okay i'm not

733
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,440
going to use any curved

734
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,799
results that's what the

735
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,960
cromwell criteria does um

736
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,799
he rejects the same specimen so his

737
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,480
method works but it doesn't get around

738
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,279
this problem

739
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,039
because he just chucks them out the way

740
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,760
i do

741
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,039
so the multi-specimen technique was

742
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,559
supposed to correct

743
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,919
for multi-domain behavior

744
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:02,320
um and so let's try that the

745
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,880
um and it occurred to me after talking

746
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,159
to

747
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,039
thomas bernt that maybe a fragile

748
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,480
curvature

749
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,360
is caused by these weird unstable the

750
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,399
things i've been calling the bad boys

751
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,679
maybe if we af demagnetized

752
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,760
the samples is part of our paleo

753
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,279
intensity experiment so before each

754
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,480
measurement we just af

755
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,320
at 10 micro melee tesla maybe that

756
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,440
solves a problem

757
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,080
or maybe we just assume that there's a

758
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,760
bias

759
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,919
and correct for it and that's the work

760
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,039
of brendan siegen i'm not going to talk

761
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,760
about that because it's

762
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,080
i'm going to he's working on a way to

763
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,519
get around this that i think might work

764
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,200
i'm pretty excited so

765
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,120
so um i um

766
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,679
did some of these things so i'm going to

767
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,840
quickly show you the results

768
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,679
brief history of the multi-specimen

769
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,919
approach it was first proposed by

770
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:04,559
hoffman ken hoffman in 1989

771
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,200
and then deckers and bernal uh refined

772
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,080
it

773
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
and their title is reliable absolute

774
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,039
pale intensity is independent of

775
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,480
magnetic domain state so that should be

776
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,279
a good place to start

777
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,399
then fabian and leonhardt uh refined it

778
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,960
even more

779
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,679
and it's supposed to be better for

780
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,039
domain state correction

781
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,000
and so um let's try those out

782
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,240
on one of the sets of age specimens so

783
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,039
here

784
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,000
i took uh one batch and applied

785
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,000
the um

786
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,360
did did the decker's bernal approach

787
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,880
to uh this the upper left

788
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,240
is decker's bernal on our ss sample so

789
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,679
the single domain

790
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,720
and you can see that the um the

791
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,960
result is does not include

792
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
the lab field which was 70 microteslas

793
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,760
so this is not

794
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,600
an accurate this is inaccurate and it

795
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,720
has low bias

796
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,840
and these are the single domain ones

797
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,559
then if you do the fabian and leonhardt

798
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,480
correction

799
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:18,480
it's uh worse so um

800
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:22,320
it has a an expected field of

801
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,840
57 microtesla instead of 70.

802
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,200
then the um the ones with the hook

803
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,399
this the hooked ones the straight went

804
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,559
curved um ones that's pretty accurate

805
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,919
on the decker's bernal but then when you

806
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,039
apply the fabian

807
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,720
leonhardt correction it's inaccurate

808
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,760
and a low bias then for the larger grain

809
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,200
sizes

810
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,559
the decker's bernal method

811
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,120
on the the cs samples

812
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,559
the ones with fragile curvature you get

813
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,279
the right answer but it's

814
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,880
extremely imprecise of course i suppose

815
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,960
you could do more specimens in there and

816
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,760
try to tamp it down

817
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,399
and when you do the fabian and leonhardt

818
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,720
correction

819
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,840
you get the right answer right it's it's

820
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,200
pretty good

821
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,399
so um the

822
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:18,320
the curvature ones uh

823
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:22,159
the the coarsest grain ones the cc's

824
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,679
um the decker's bernal approach

825
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,040
the error bars include the right answer

826
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,280
um it's very imprecise and um

827
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,440
but when you apply the decker's bernal

828
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,800
the fabian leonhardt correction you get

829
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,200
the wrong answer

830
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,359
and it's biased low so i'm not very

831
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,440
optimistic about this technique

832
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,800
solving our problem because the thing

833
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,480
that was supposed to fix

834
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:50,240
were the things on the lower um lower

835
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:54,800
row there so maybe there's another way

836
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:58,560
um uh we uh

837
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,920
and that is to do this af izzy uh

838
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,440
technique and so i did a bunch or

839
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,480
christiane did a bunch

840
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,240
on um specimens from

841
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,520
position two the 35 microtest and 70

842
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,480
microtesla

843
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,920
um fields these are all of the remaining

844
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,520
samples

845
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,560
and so you can see on the top row

846
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,880
that's the results of our af izzy

847
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,760
and you can see that on the right hand

848
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,960
side

849
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:33,680
as a curved went curved this af

850
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:37,200
izzy did not cure the curvature

851
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,520
and uh and i was hoping it would

852
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,400
but it doesn't the stuff still curved

853
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,119
it's still

854
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,480
and so is it still biased

855
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,000
so af izzy um here

856
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,960
are the curvature results uh on the

857
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,800
upper

858
00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:00,480
left hand side the curve the

859
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,240
results of af izzy of course these were

860
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,160
there's a i mean there's a technical

861
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,760
difference between these these were aged

862
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,599
five years before we got around to

863
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,520
measuring them instead of two years so

864
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,560
there's a slight difference

865
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,000
however it seems pretty clear that af

866
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,720
izzy

867
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,839
resulted in worse curvature

868
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,119
in all cases and

869
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,240
the total trms are

870
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,320
um interestingly for the

871
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:36,320
finest grain material are um

872
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:39,920
biased high so

873
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,400
i don't know uh and with the plain izzy

874
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,520
uh

875
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,119
the curved results were biased low

876
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,599
so maybe five milli teslas is better i

877
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,040
don't know

878
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,920
but um i'm i'm now uh over

879
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,320
curved results and so um what i want to

880
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,760
do

881
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,960
is to encourage uh brendan

882
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,040
to work on on his idea

883
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,160
of how to fix this so stay tuned i'm

884
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:11,359
not gonna talk about that

885
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,839
right now okay

886
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,839
questions

887
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,200
excellent thank you very much lisa that

888
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,240
was uh that's a really interesting

889
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,599
somebody said they think that's an

890
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
interesting talk if you can hear my

891
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,440
background

892
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,440
um i'll just ask everybody to join me in

893
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,880
a virtual round of applause for lisa you

894
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,400
can do that through zoom or you can just

895
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,079
hold your hands up to the camera and

896
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,040
clap that's a really interesting

897
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:40,320
um presentation so i will um

898
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,960
open open the floor to any questions for

899
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,960
for lisa

900
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,920
and i do have a bundle so um i will

901
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,839
invite other people before i

902
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,839
uh jump in

903
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,320
i will say i'm loving your curvature

904
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,079
parameter

905
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,119
uh yeah i think i mean it's um

906
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,119
yes bds not so much but yeah i mean the

907
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,560
curvature is a very much it's a

908
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,359
you know an empirical thing it's a

909
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,839
geometry of of how the arrive plot um

910
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,800
behaves and it's kind of intuitive that

911
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,400
um

912
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,920
you have a higher chance of getting or

913
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,640
selecting a sort of

914
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,960
inaccurate result if you're a right plot

915
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,240
isn't

916
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,000
isn't straight um so

917
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,040
i'm going to jump in with a question

918
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,160
about your multi-specimen stuff

919
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:35,760
um so you're comparing the um

920
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:40,640
the decorative bonnell method and the

921
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,720
um uh fabian uh corrected method

922
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,920
is that when you're doing the decoration

923
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,160
banal that's just the

924
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,040
original method that's not taking the

925
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,680
fraction

926
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,760
correction into account is it no it was

927
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,480
just the original one as proposed

928
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,520
and then i used the fabian and but but

929
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,040
that one

930
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,160
it seems to work better than the the

931
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,920
mainstay corrected one of fabian

932
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,200
so the i guess i mean the domain state

933
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,599
corrected one

934
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,880
kind of always shifts the result

935
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,520
downwards it can never

936
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,960
increase the intensity but i wonder if

937
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,800
if some of the results if

938
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,480
you just did the fraction correction but

939
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,160
not the domain state correction if that

940
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
might actually give

941
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,240
you know you've got accurate and more

942
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,119
more precision maybe

943
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,680
and something i'm not optimistic maybe

944
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,480
um

945
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,800
but but my feeling is that you don't

946
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,000
know which category you're in

947
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,040
if you do this you only know that do a

948
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,079
full

949
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,440
uh paleo intensity experiment um

950
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,480
that and that only some

951
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,000
of the specimens performed

952
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,640
well with um with the

953
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
any of the multi-specimen approaches and

954
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,960
so my feeling is that

955
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,240
if if your samples are are curved or

956
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,079
biased or

957
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,520
have this fragile curvature that you're

958
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,520
basically

959
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,599
if you don't know that you are going to

960
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,560
make a mistake you're going to be

961
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,839
um you're just not you're going to have

962
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,480
to by especially

963
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,400
um i said adrian did you flash your hand

964
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,599
up for a quick question i don't see you

965
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,119
up anymore um but if anybody has a

966
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,280
question you can just

967
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,040
raise your hands through some otherwise

968
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,680
i will i'll just dominate and ask

969
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,240
tons more questions are clear clear has

970
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,079
a question

971
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,599
clear nichols when you go clear all

972
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,480
right look at the wrong screen

973
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,480
i'm yeah um hi lisa great talk i was

974
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,640
just wondering with the

975
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,160
uh you see the bios after two years as

976
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,000
five microtesla and

977
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,440
i guess if that's a linear bias that

978
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,160
gets worse most of the time

979
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,359
then it's a big problem but do you know

980
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,359
if it actually gets

981
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,440
much worse very quickly and then kind of

982
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,839
settles or if it continues like

983
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,839
is it twice as bad after five years

984
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:01,280
it's time to talk to you in five years

985
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,319
i i just uh in order to do these last

986
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,200
two experiments

987
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,000
the last three ideas i used up all the

988
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,599
specimens that were

989
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,079
aging and so now we don't have any more

990
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,040
so someone else can start i just retired

991
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,400
so

992
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:20,160
i've gotta be here to get to the answer

993
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,800
um uh i think it keeps getting worse

994
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,960
i don't know the answer if you look at

995
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,800
the original era plots

996
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,079
for some of these they're really very

997
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,520
curved and so i

998
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,480
imagine that the curvature just was

999
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,200
you know over a hundred thousand years i

1000
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,480
don't know

1001
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,599
okay have to start aging some samples

1002
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,680
why don't you do it we'll talk to you in

1003
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,200
five years ten years

1004
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,880
so it sounds like somebody could start a

1005
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,160
career out of this

1006
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,140
um so uh andre you have your hand up

1007
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,140
[Music]

1008
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,280
oh okay now

1009
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,160
okay now yeah okay

1010
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,160
okay eliza

1011
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,400
well there is a

1012
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,440
brief question and also a sort of

1013
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
suggestion

1014
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,640
uh first

1015
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,000
when you see in your curved

1016
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,000
nagatara plots

1017
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,640
how did your ptrm checks generally

1018
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,640
behave

1019
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,440
these samples were chosen because they

1020
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,280
had all

1021
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,400
undergone a atelier experiment

1022
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,359
and had shown no alteration so the

1023
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,800
alteration checks on these were fine

1024
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,839
that's not the issue

1025
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,200
here in this case all right

1026
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,760
let's still uh okay i might i'm

1027
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,520
i may be blowing in my own trumpet but

1028
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,040
uh okay

1029
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,760
uh some 20 20 plus years ago

1030
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,319
mr michelle prabhu and i published the

1031
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,319
paper

1032
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:15,440
which showed what you call fragile

1033
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,520
uh curvature and we did the same

1034
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,359
we did basically the same experiment

1035
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,400
with two

1036
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:27,839
what was that published we published

1037
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,839
the the paper in ggi in 98

1038
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,800
and we did basically the same experiment

1039
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,839
and

1040
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,960
ended up with basically the same

1041
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,760
the same conclusion that you have you

1042
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,880
have very

1043
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,760
very curved negative right plots on

1044
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,640
original

1045
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,480
samples and then you get uh almost

1046
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,560
straight lines when you do the

1047
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:59,200
chile experiment on the turtle theory

1048
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:02,720
and we we did the we went a little bit

1049
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,480
further on on the rock mug line and

1050
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,000
investigated the hysteresis loops

1051
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:15,440
at elevated temperatures

1052
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,440
and actually we found out that

1053
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,480
in all in all these samples with a

1054
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,920
fragile curvature was good good term

1055
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,800
okay they showed uh

1056
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,359
they showed up very very characteristic

1057
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,240
changes in coercivity

1058
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,119
upon heating and it was sufficient to

1059
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,040
heat up the

1060
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:44,400
samples to something like

1061
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,440
250 to 75 degrees centigrade to end up

1062
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,160
with very

1063
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,800
this clearly irreversible behavior of

1064
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,240
history

1065
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,319
of high studies and our

1066
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,520
our interpretation with michelle was

1067
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,480
that uh

1068
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,839
when you hit this uh when you hit the

1069
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,160
samples

1070
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:06,800
with this and we change this

1071
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,440
the internal stresses which which

1072
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,359
controls

1073
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,240
the core civility and that's

1074
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,599
and unfortunately the answer to your

1075
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,200
last question

1076
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,680
seems that there is no remedy apart from

1077
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,720
this

1078
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,960
perhaps this

1079
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,280
[Music]

1080
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,520
if this interpretation is correct then

1081
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,839
the our only hope would be this

1082
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,680
numerical

1083
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,240
correction but once again we

1084
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,599
we need to figure out how to do that

1085
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,280
properly

1086
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,839
so maybe brennan can get a seminar in uh

1087
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,200
maybe a month a couple weeks or a month

1088
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,800
um

1089
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,319
because he's about to submit a

1090
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,359
manuscript which i

1091
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:54,720
i think may be

1092
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:58,319
a way forward yeah of course and

1093
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,520
uh one thing to uh one thing to

1094
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,880
recall about this whole study was that

1095
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,760
the pro the worst uh curved

1096
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,480
sample was there was one with the

1097
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,520
largest

1098
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,640
mrsms ratio

1099
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,920
of something 0.3 so it was nearly

1100
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,359
in the single domain verge

1101
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,079
i don't know yeah and the coercivity was

1102
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,599
something like 40 30 milli tesla and

1103
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,040
still it behaved

1104
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:34,079
terribly but mind you but in that case

1105
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:38,160
uh we did see the we did see the

1106
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,599
failed ptrm checks at the uh

1107
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,480
where the where the curvature was

1108
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,599
developed

1109
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,599
because well

1110
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,240
okay yeah richard has a question now

1111
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,160
yeah i agree we'll move on to it

1112
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,280
otherwise we'll lose all of our time

1113
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,839
yeah okay um okay so

1114
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,280
a non-paleomagnetist question so

1115
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,720
implications

1116
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,480
um so we spent many years doing analysis

1117
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,920
of all sorts of or putting into models

1118
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,880
all sorts of data

1119
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,480
so for example it always puzzled me that

1120
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
the field seems to be stronger now than

1121
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,319
it was in the past

1122
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,599
could this be part of the the story

1123
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,880
behind that

1124
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:24,480
um is this only volcanic

1125
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,920
so are kim

1126
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,880
but i i do think that to feel the

1127
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,720
stronger

1128
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,079
the present than in the past because if

1129
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,680
you choose only

1130
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,960
uh good results that have straight

1131
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,160
era plots that's what it shows so i i'm

1132
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,520
confident now but

1133
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,880
this does raise a question so how

1134
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,119
how about results in uh

1135
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,960
databases that do not include the

1136
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,000
original measurements

1137
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,359
what confidence can we have in those

1138
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,359
results

1139
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,559
like for example the pint database that

1140
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,599
has just studied

1141
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:05,520
just site level uh

1142
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,520
estimates and you have no idea about

1143
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,040
where they curve did they not occur

1144
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,319
where were they yeah

1145
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,800
so um uh

1146
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,480
i'm advocating for people putting their

1147
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,880
data into the database

1148
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,000
and the good news is that if brendan's

1149
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,200
method does work

1150
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,640
then we can rescue a lot of results

1151
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:30,319
and correct for this bias but

1152
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,599
um for now you know that story about the

1153
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,960
high field recently

1154
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,559
is is a lot of archaeological data and

1155
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,839
archaeological artifacts um

1156
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,880
despi was on uh she can attest to the

1157
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,960
fact that

1158
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,880
a lot of um archaeological

1159
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,440
archaeomagnetic data are really

1160
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,160
great they're straight eri plots they're

1161
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,359
not don't

1162
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,359
have this problem it's only when you get

1163
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,359
back further further in time and i would

1164
00:48:53,359 --> 00:49:00,000
say that this is a general problem of

1165
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:02,480
lava flows but not of the lava flow tops

1166
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,079
which are glassy or finer grained and

1167
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,280
then you get yourself into the single

1168
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,520
domain range

1169
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,720
and so you can get good results from

1170
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,760
lava flows as shown by cromwell

1171
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,440
and um and that's been our approach

1172
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,240
for the last 30 30 years

1173
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,359
20 long time 20 since 1990 i started

1174
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,040
trying to find

1175
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,319
single domain material um

1176
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,760
i'm very pleased that you're not

1177
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,200
throwing away the glassy breathing

1178
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,559
otherwise you might disappear out your

1179
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,599
own um

1180
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,240
so that's very good to hear i'm not

1181
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,440
throwing away the glassy stuff although

1182
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,119
really bowls might

1183
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,599
for me for some other reason

1184
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,359
i don't know no but i mean i can

1185
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,040
appreciate what you're saying about

1186
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,800
trying to find the best data but when

1187
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,319
you were going through your conditions

1188
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,400
i have to admit i was less worried about

1189
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,119
the one that was kind of imprecise but

1190
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,599
at least

1191
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,480
accurate i didn't care so much because

1192
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,960
there it's the

1193
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,240
it's the consistency it's the systematic

1194
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,520
bias that's the problem

1195
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,720
if you've got inaccurate but accurate

1196
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,480
but or accurate but um wide sounds that

1197
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:13,839
just take lots of the data

1198
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,839
that's right so that's

1199
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,000
give me another five years and maybe

1200
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:27,599
we'll solve it

1201
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,839
um i just want to thank uh lisa again um

1202
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,119
for a fantastic talk some really

1203
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,119
interesting stuff in there

1204
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,480
and i'm looking forward to uh some of

1205
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,640
the future stuff

1206
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,680
um as i note because you kept mentioning

1207
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,280
brendan's

1208
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,119
method and brendan should give a

1209
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,400
presentation he ate

1210
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,319
bread and such actually gave a

1211
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,359
presentation as part of

1212
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,400
uh magnetic interactions um earlier uh

1213
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,040
this year

1214
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,839
um as part of magnets we recorded that

1215
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,520
seminar

1216
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,839
and one of my magnets duties is to

1217
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,359
upload all of those videos online uh

1218
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,480
which is coming

1219
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,280
they are um coming on so everyone um can

1220
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,119
catch up on

1221
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,440
on uh magnetic interactions um 2020 and

1222
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,680
brendan's talk and his uh pretty cool

1223
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,960
looking method of of correcting

1224
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,599
um some of these uh biases so i just

1225
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,760
want to thank

1226
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,880
uh lisa once again and you can throw up

1227
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,280
another virtual

1228
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,000
uh round of applause for for lisa for a

1229
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,200
fantastic

1230
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,640
talk um

1231
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,599
and and before we um bring um today's

1232
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,520
obsession to

1233
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,880
to a close um i just want to remind

1234
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,520
everybody um that

1235
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,480
that moving into 2021 we've got several

1236
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,319
more people

1237
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,359
uh lined up to to give presentations

1238
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,920
so we're going to be running the

1239
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,359
seminars um every two weeks

1240
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,040
uh and you can see that we've we've

1241
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,400
already got

1242
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,440
our lineup for the next few weeks a few

1243
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,480
months sorry

1244
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,680
um we're going to take a break for uh

1245
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,040
egu and to give people um a little bit

1246
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,160
of a chance to

1247
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,040
uh not be bombarded by too many um

1248
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,760
seminars um but after egu we're actually

1249
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,720
going to change

1250
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,800
um our time slot a little bit um so that

1251
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,280
we're running in an eu

1252
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,960
um eastern hemisphere slot so that we

1253
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,720
have a chance for

1254
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,319
some of our colleagues in australia and

1255
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,880
china and japan

1256
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,760
to join these seminars live but also to

1257
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,000
to actually

1258
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,200
um present some of the science that that

1259
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,440
they're doing

1260
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,520
um and i'll give more details about that

1261
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,920
um later on as we get closer to that

1262
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,680
time

1263
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,599
but we've got a few a few people lined

1264
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,480
up and to give a range of

1265
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,440
of talks and and as we move forward into

1266
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,359
2021

1267
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,160
um we're we're always looking for more

1268
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:45,040
speakers so if anybody is interested in

1269
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,559
giving a seminar um please just um get

1270
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,079
in touch with us

1271
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:53,680
and we can sort out a future slot

1272
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:57,680
um and one last little mention is um

1273
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,960
up until now um our magnet seminars have

1274
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,720
been made available through

1275
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,640
the magic youtube channel and i want to

1276
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,680
thank the magic team

1277
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,160
for helping us get started and host that

1278
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,440
moving forward we will have our own

1279
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,119
dedicated

1280
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,839
magnets youtube channel where these

1281
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,359
videos will be

but this will have our 2021 series

1286
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,160
and i'll have the magnetic interactions

1287
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,200
uh seminars as well

1288
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,240

1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,240
perfect all right so i'm allison klein

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,480
and i'm from

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,320
imperial college london and this is my

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,240
first magnetic interactions conference

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,679
so i'm very happy to be here

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
and so i'm going to talk you through my

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
poster which is on magnetic recording of

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,000
earth's history

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
which describes a 3d nanoscale method

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,439
for characterization

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,039
of a single crystal which was collected

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,199
at glenn mountain

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,279
so by using practical and theoretical

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,960
approaches it allows us to accurately

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,880
determine the behavior of natural

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,120
samples which will lead to more accurate

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,040
paleo intensity estimates

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
so the key to predicting the magnetic

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,239
response of a sample

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,480
is in the detailed morphology

21
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,719
distributions and these can contain

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
distributions of millions of particles

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,559
in this case magnetite and these all

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
have different shapes and sizes

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,120
which defines their unique magnetic

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,680
behavior and recording fidelity

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,360
so how do we measure these green sizes

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
is we use a technique called slice and

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
view

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,960
and we do this on an instrument fib sem

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
and what we do is we use the focused

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,720
iron beam to mill a slice

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,560
and then we image the corresponding

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
slice with the sem

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
so what we can do is process these sem

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,920
images

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
and realign them to produce a 3d

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,200
reconstruction

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
like what we see here where we can

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,080
undertake some quantitative particle

41
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,439
metrics

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,119
so what we're seeing here is quite

43
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,960
interesting distribution so we are

44
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,320
seeing a number of grains with a variety

45
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,159
of different sizes

46
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
so we are seeing more of the regular

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
simple ellipsoids that we would expect

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
to see but we're also seeing these

49
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
uh non-interacting highly elongated

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,759
particles

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,840
that run pretty much the full size

52
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,240
thickness which is nearly 2.5 microns

53
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,360
um which yeah but which is interesting

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,920
um so the combination of this a

55
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,759
nanometer a tomography and the

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
micromagnetic simulations here on the

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,920
right

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,439
allows us to better understand the link

59
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,479
between the morphologies and the

60
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,719
magnetic

61
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,719
properties so the resulting remnant

62
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,200
states is what we see here

63
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,560
and this includes a single domain and

64
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
single vortex

65
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
which are the two domain states that we

66
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,239
would expect to dominate

67
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,759
the remnant magnetization in the vast

68
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
majority of samples

69
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,040
but what's interesting here is that

70
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
we're also seeing a

71
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,800
some multi-domain for these larger

72
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,319
elongated particles

73
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
and so this is just a quick summary of

74
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,720
what we've been working on at the moment

75
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,239
there's quite a lot today still to do

76
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,599
melee simulation work which includes

77
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,959
hysteresis forks uh relaxation times

78
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,040
um but that's what we've been working on

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,720
at the moment um

80
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
yeah if anyone has any questions i would

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,400
love to speak to you i've recently

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,200
transferred from physics to

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,239
paleomagnetism so i would be lovely to

84
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,920
speak to you

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:50,560
and yeah that's pretty much it thank you

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,160
okay

87
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:59,599
so anybody else want to jump in there

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:04,159
okay maybe i'll start to share my screen

89
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,720
yeah yeah

90
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,849
okay

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,849
[Music]

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,879
okay do you see my screen

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,120
yeah okay in the poster i would like to

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,879
present some work that i done last year

95
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,239
when i was on my thursday in cambridge

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,360
and um the motivation

97
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,080
to this study uh

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,840
was a great concern about environmental

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,239
protections and

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,440
uh rehabilitation of the environment

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,280
especially after

102
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,440
running exploration and knowing that

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
heavy metals that are one of the major

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,720
pollution pollutants

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,760
in soils are

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,680
associated with magnetic particles

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,280
i thought that it might be a good idea

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,439
to

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,319
check how those particles

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,879
uh behave in source if there are any

111
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,319
trends

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,840
uh with time and so on so

113
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,879
uh three former mining areas uh that are

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,599
located here

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,199
uh were sampled and sourced from that

116
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,680
area was sampled

117
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,959
to characterize magnetic meteorology and

118
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,759
find this correlation

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,639
is there any actually between magnetic

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,680
properties

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,840
magnetic finger fingerprints and

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,120
ores that was exploited actually

123
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,720
uh we sampled mainly soils uh

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,479
surrounding spoiled hips and mine waste

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,520
but also soils developed on

126
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,759
those ways called tecnosols

127
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,520
and what can be seen from the results

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,919
from thermal magnetic curves

129
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
the mineralogy is quite well diversified

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
with

131
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,479
magnetite and hematite that are main

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
magnetic phases but also iron sulfides

133
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,479
and

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,840
probably machiamite is also present here

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,479
and unfortunately si

136
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
um and x-ray diffraction was much

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,880
helpful

138
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:18,800
in disentangling this mineralogy however

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
using fork pca we can observe that there

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,840
is

141
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,199
a diversification in terms of grain size

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,479
of those

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,440
magnetic phases however there is a

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,800
common

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,919
thing that is shown here so

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,000
in both technology

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,120
and source surrounding mine waste

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,520
we observed uh quite

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:49,520
distinct particles not interacting spsd

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,919
particles with varying coercivity

151
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
that most likely is of anthropogenic

152
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,240
origin

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:01,520
and it could be also divided as

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,960
separate end members in a particular

155
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,360
sites actually and what is

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:13,280
more important this particle seems to be

157
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
quite persistent as they

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,800
are present in a relatively unchanged

159
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,919
form

160
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,240
in source uh that were developed 50

161
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,039
years and 400 years ago

162
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,960
so if you're interested in if sorry if

163
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,319
you're interested please join me in the

164
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,840
poster hall

165
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,520
i'll be happy to answer all questions

166
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,280
thanks

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,600
okay who's next in line and you want to

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
shout

169
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:48,639
is that handle from ursula there

170
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:52,479
whenever you're ready

171
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,440
can you see that yeah

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,919
um so this project it's i'm a fourth

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,160
year

174
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,039
earth sciences student supervised by

175
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,080
rich harrison

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
as well and uh

177
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,599
and this this project is

178
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
part of an ongoing masters project so

179
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,160
i'm really just presenting the

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
uh like an overview and preliminary

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,440
results

182
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,800
um so it's characterizing

183
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,360
broadly speaking the remnant

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
magnetic carriers in quadratic

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,759
meteorites

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,599
and one of the main ways

187
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
that we're doing this or at least it's

188
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,199
an emphasis for the project

189
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,400
is using micromagnetic modeling

190
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
techniques

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,319
and um it is basically applying the same

192
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,720
methods as

193
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
alison cohen's group on the glenn

194
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,680
mountain

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:55,680
crystal we're using focused iron beam

196
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,240
3d tomography methods and

197
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,800
merrell code for the micromagnetic

198
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,039
simulations

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,039
and

200
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,960
yeah with our case study sample

201
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,000
is a c2 meteorite this one

202
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,879
um something which james bryson has

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
recently done

204
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,039
a bit of work on and last time i checked

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,120
he's he's here so

206
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,919
um we did some we had a brief sem

207
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
session

208
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,360
and this this is some backscatter images

209
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,919
which i've pulled

210
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
and put on here because they're some of

211
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,880
the the more

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,880
unusual and interesting they show

213
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,399
some of the the more interesting spatial

214
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,440
distributions of

215
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,839
iron-rich phases and

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
i haven't i haven't really yet looked

217
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,959
beyond a few papers

218
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,320
into this exactly how they relate to

219
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,040
how they're formed and how they relate

220
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,040
to some of the larger morphologies that

221
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,600
the project is focused on

222
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
i'm not not sure at all so that that's

223
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,800
if anyone

224
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,000
has any ideas or wants to pass comment

225
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,200
on that

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,120
um come and find me i'm also looking for

227
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,720
phd opportunities

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,240
so uh that's that's the scope of the

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,560
project

230
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
so yeah i'll be in the poster hall after

231
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,080
this

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,240
so anybody else want to jump in thanks

233
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,200
for that ursula and

234
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,200
anybody want to shout

235
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,240
i'll go but i want to wait a little

236
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,560
second because there's some chickens in

237
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,399
the garden that are shouting very loud

238
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,600
so i don't want to bother anyone but

239
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,720
um here's my poster

240
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,760
um essentially i've been looking at a

241
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,320
series of mesoproterozoic giant dykes in

242
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,240
southern greenland and i've particularly

243
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,200
tried been trying to figure out their

244
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,120
emplacement history and post and

245
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,920
placement mechanisms that have occurred

246
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
by using rock magnetics and so i titled

247
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,399
it trying to

248
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,800
try and decipher the primary flow from

249
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
interstitial mouth migration

250
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,240
so i went out to to grain into map

251
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
collect samples and then

252
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,160
did a bunch of photography and rock

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,560
magnetics

254
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,560
and i've been trying to

255
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,839
trying to integrate a a model

256
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,600
or try to produce a petrogenic model of

257
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,839
the system

258
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
where we can

259
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
sorry i've got lost my train of thought

260
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
so

261
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,320
i've been trying to integrate the

262
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,079
in-phase ams and outfit ams

263
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,480
using other rock magnetic techniques

264
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,839
such as susceptibility experiments

265
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,959
and arm to try and figure out what

266
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,839
um magnetic clusters that the

267
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,279
these different experiments are

268
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
measuring

269
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,720
and ultimately what we've what i've gone

270
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,640
into so far

271
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
is that it seems like these giant dike

272
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,079
systems which

273
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
reach up to 800 meters wide probably

274
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,640
didn't intrude as a classic

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,279
penny shaped crack dike but more as a

276
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,120
series of fingered loaves

277
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,040
intruding and coalescing in an

278
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,320
extensional regime

279
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,040
um and what i'm trying to do following

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,279
that now

281
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,120
is to try and see we've found some

282
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,399
evidence that there's potentially some

283
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
compaction occurring and there's

284
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,560
evidence of melt segregation and so we

285
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,760
think that maybe

286
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,000
the finer grain rock magnetic

287
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,680
uh clusters are recording these later

288
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,519
stage migrations

289
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,360
um and we have some exciting clues that

290
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,760
that does seem to be the case and that

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,399
the

292
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,200
out of phase and the arn are indicating

293
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,839
a

294
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,680
a secondary fabric that isn't recorded

295
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,120
in phase ams

296
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,480
um and ultimately the current

297
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
interpretations that i have

298
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,760
are that these systems are intruding

299
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
in a series of convective loads that are

300
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,639
later than

301
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,720
um post-deposition and crystallization

302
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
the last gasps are these interstitial

303
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
amounts that are almost built to press

304
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,959
down

305
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
but if you're interested in anything

306
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,760
that we've been talking about in

307
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
particular if anyone has any ideas as to

308
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,839
how

309
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,240
i can further test um what out of phase

310
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:25,839
ams is recording please do

311
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,839
come around

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,880
cool thanks lot uh is there anybody else

313
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,160
who wants to pipe up or shout

314
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,040
i see a handle from rory there yeah sure

315
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,360
i'll go next

316
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,160
um since i'm also looking at the younger

317
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:52,800
giant dykes

318
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:56,399
of greenland

319
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,399
there we go can you see my screen

320
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
cool so uh yes i'm also looking at the

321
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
same area

322
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,639
that lots looking at at lots areas down

323
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
in this blue bit here called cesarotoc

324
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,279
and i'm looking at an area just

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,360
to the north at sorotit so um

326
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,800
basically this is part of the gardar

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
province of

328
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,880
southern greenland and these are um

329
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,839
neoproterozoic dikes which were

330
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,519
in place during failed intercontinental

331
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,680
rift environment and they reach

332
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
up to 800 meters wide and the

333
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
interesting thing about these dikes are

334
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,600
that they have these

335
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,680
discrete domains within them of

336
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,320
different either compositions or

337
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,120
layering differences um or both in some

338
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
cases

339
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,800
and so i've been looking at places where

340
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,800
the composition changes

341
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,480
into these these pods of more evolved

342
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,760
composition

343
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,160
and so i've been doing an ams study i've

344
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
done

345
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,320
three transects across this pod where we

346
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,279
have tropical light at the margins

347
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,480
going through sinogabro to port cyanide

348
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,360
at the center

349
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
and um preliminary results that i've

350
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,040
found so far

351
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,839
is that um so these between these two

352
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,800
pods we have a numbering here

353
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,839
and this looks like the pods are

354
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
representing

355
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,240
fingers which are inflating and pressing

356
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,000
up against um

357
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,399
walls between the the pods and then

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,160
forming almost broken bridge structures

359
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,720
um as these uh dykes coalesce and um

360
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,680
and meet up the as these lobes meet up

361
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,360
um

362
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,720
and uh also the lineations generally are

363
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,760
pointing towards the

364
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,000
north east and

365
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,360
just to try and put this into a bit of

366
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
context with this

367
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,000
area on the in figure a we have

368
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,120
essentially the area that lots looking

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,760
at which is

370
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
structurally deeper within the dike and

371
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,480
um

372
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,240
we're seeing that the formation of

373
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,199
layering and

374
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,519
what i'm proposing is that this

375
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,519
formation of layering and foliation

376
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,920
we have an interstitial melt formation

377
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
which then is migrating upwards in the

378
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,440
dike

379
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,560
um and forming these um zones of more

380
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,240
evolved composition

381
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,399
and so these pods um are formed through

382
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,440
the the secondary placement of material

383
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,399
which is formed

384
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,240
from within this dike complex and is

385
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,760
migrating upwards within it

386
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,800
um and so yeah i encourage any of you to

387
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,199
come and check out my

388
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,839
poster very kindly put it right at the

389
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,920
front

390
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,120
and yeah please come and chat to me this

391
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,120
is my

392
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
this is for my mgl undergraduate

393
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,480
dissertation and

394
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,399
it's very much still a work in progress

395
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,240
so i'd love to chat to

396
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:41,839
anyone about my ams data and tx results

397
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,839
and these amazing giant bikes

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,399
okay is there anybody else

399
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,920
so um actually i have a poster as well

400
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,519
so i just want to very quickly go

401
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
through it myself so i'll just share my

402
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,920
own screen

403
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,160
if you don't mind um

404
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,680
so can you guys see that all right two

405
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,240
seconds

406
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,600
so are you can you guys see that yeah

407
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399
sure

408
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
cool so just in case um you for anybody

409
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,000
who doesn't know me

410
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,600
my own name is vincent toomey um i'm a

411
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,519
final year phd student

412
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
here in the university of saint andrews

413
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,040
working with will

414
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,160
and as part of my phd here i'm trying

415
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,440
this new project

416
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,240
so i'm trying to couple

417
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,519
detailed structural mapping of a

418
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
magmatic body

419
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,440
and linking it with paleomagnetic

420
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
analysis

421
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,759
so effectively just to kind of give you

422
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,560
a quick update that when you know

423
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,880
when a magma intrudes into a host rock

424
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,920
structure forcefully intrudes into it

425
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,519
and can buckle and bend the the

426
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,639
surrounding hose rack around it and

427
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,399
could ultimately

428
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,680
produce these intrusion-induced

429
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,920
forcefolds

430
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,920
which obviously form synchronously with

431
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,759
the intrusion of the the body

432
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,559
so um i the aim is to actually test this

433
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,400
hypothesis

434
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,439
where the so the premise behind this

435
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,799
hypothesis to

436
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,199
um is that the paleomagnetic analysis

437
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,400
and that the thermal remnant

438
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,400
magnetization

439
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,480
could be expected to successfully

440
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
overprint the host rock

441
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,720
primary remnant magnetization as the hot

442
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,439
magma from the body

443
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,520
increment like incrementally injects and

444
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,840
displaces that host rock

445
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,799
so like effectively as the plutonium

446
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,559
places

447
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,880
the whole structure like it the

448
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,960
plutonium will in place and inflate

449
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,280
and so the the trm could be expected

450
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,880
like

451
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,720
the paleo the subsequent magnetic

452
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
vectors could be expected to change over

453
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
that

454
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,520
so ultimately the the goal is is to see

455
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,640
that can the pmag

456
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,880
help like record this progressive and

457
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
or even stepwise or punctuated host rock

458
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,360
deformation

459
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,919
during this informational lack of

460
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,840
construction and in turn can it actually

461
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,480
constrain the rate and duration of

462
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,559
cooling

463
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,160
particularly in rapidly in place bodies

464
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,000
in the shallow crust

465
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
so some of me are familiar with this

466
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,840
area in eastern iceland

467
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,840
sand fell so this is my study area so

468
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,640
basically this is just the preliminary

469
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,240
analysis so basically i collected a

470
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
suite of pmax samples along the

471
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,120
structural oriole and the reason why we

472
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,760
went to sandfell is that the actual

473
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,679
exposure is very good so you got these

474
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,919
very well exposed intrusion and juice

475
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,160
forceful and you can actually see that

476
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,160
the actual dip value of these

477
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,760
uh lava of the neogene lava piles in

478
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,919
eastern iceland actually

479
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,280
changes and actually steepens away from

480
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,520
the contact

481
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,039
and so this is just the initial analysis

482
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,960
that the next step for me which is i'm

483
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,320
effectively jumping into now

484
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,880
is do the pca analysis and actually see

485
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,559
if this um pmag data is actually worthy

486
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,480
now the initial

487
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,280
like there are some little kinks in the

488
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,720
data so this actually could be showing

489
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,320
the the switch or an influence from

490
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,520
the magma body so if anybody has any

491
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,039
any kind of input on you know any

492
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,520
caveats or any advice or

493
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,799
seen some similar project come to my

494
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
poster

495
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,840
um now i'm kind of abusing my power now

496
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,559
as convening this session

497
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,240
and instead of you know being at the pub

498
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,240
last night i actually kind of put

499
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,400
together a very quick poster

500
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,320
that's not in the abstract but it's

501
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,440
actually from another part of my phd

502
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,520
that um that

503
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,440
that i've actually submitted to the gel

504
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,400
sock before christmas so fingers crossed

505
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,000
but

506
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
i just put this together quickly last

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,559
night just to kind of show you what the

508
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,840
work is

509
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,679
so as will mentioned in his talk

510
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,760
and that you know the ams has been used

511
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
for decades now to constrain

512
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
magma flow dynamics and then placement

513
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,720
mechanisms

514
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,400
and however a lot of the times it just

515
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,080
it comes up with the actual internal

516
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,120
dynamics of a magmatic body

517
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,440
and it doesn't give much constraints in

518
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,360
terms of what the

519
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,559
the implications of these emplacement

520
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,799
mechanisms actually have

521
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,640
on subsequent or associated volcanism

522
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,679
with these intrusive bodies

523
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,559
so again similarly enough i use detailed

524
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,600
you know like you know by combining

525
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,960
structural mapping

526
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,720
drone work with ams as a complement

527
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,159
i actually map out this another

528
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,679
very well exposed um subvolcanic

529
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,840
silicic body in iceland and actually map

530
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,600
and do a pretty comprehensive ams

531
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,880
analysis with detailed structural

532
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
mapping

533
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,919
around its associated structural oriole

534
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
now

535
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,679
the results i came out with with the ams

536
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,919
suite in the main body of the lacklus

537
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,679
again is this kind of classic

538
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,960
low bait structures where effectively

539
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,280
the k1s

540
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:54,400
are orientated along this northeast

541
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,480
north east southwest axis which actually

542
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,720
is quite comparable with the regional

543
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,880
trend of the faults and fractures

544
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,080
across within and beyond the structural

545
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,600
orioles

546
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,400
now and so the lobes are actually

547
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,640
based on the wrapping around of the

548
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,679
magnetic foliation

549
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,840
uh along the actual the the

550
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,039
the pretty pervasive northeast southwest

551
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,440
trend of the k1 values which

552
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,640
you know which actually show a range of

553
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,240
inclinations

554
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
now this is not new and this has been

555
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,960
published for again decades going back

556
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
to even

557
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,320
carl stevens and johnny hutton all those

558
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,000
guys both

559
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,679
both using rock magnetics and

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,240
geophysical techniques

561
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,320
but because they're copying the ams with

562
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,559
the whole strap deformation

563
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,919
the i've actually managed to map out

564
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,360
some

565
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,120
inclined sheets which are directly

566
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,559
offset from the lack of it

567
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,799
and doing an ams suite within

568
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:56,559
our around these um these incline sheets

569
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,679
we actually can we actually show how the

570
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,240
how the magma true ams now truly ams

571
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,919
data set how the magma actually migrates

572
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,039
from this laterally flowing low bait

573
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,320
structures

574
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,559
that you see here so this is a and how

575
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,640
these actual so these incline sheets

576
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,520
which are actually paralleling the

577
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,280
regional

578
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,760
fall fracture trend so in

579
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,600
actually on the lateral flanks

580
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,200
peripheral flanks are these low bait

581
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,039
structures which propagate out towards

582
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,679
the west southwest of the area

583
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,799
the magma is it's shown to actually flow

584
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,559
upwards through

585
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,559
the classic implication model which

586
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,360
simon talked on yesterday

587
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,080
and also just true and like you know

588
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,720
just truly

589
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,159
the paralleling are being sub parallel

590
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,799
to the actual

591
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,200
um wall structure of these intrusions so

592
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,039
this

593
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
this is implications for volcanism in

594
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,640
terms of you know how

595
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,320
this this actually compares with

596
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,679
geophysical observations where

597
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,000
volcanic eruptions are actually

598
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,000
laterally offset from the main magma

599
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,600
body to which it is associated with

600
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,080
but again this is another poster which i

601
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,120
just cheaply put up last night so

602
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,120
thanks very much everyone

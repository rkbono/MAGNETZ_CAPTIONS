1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
thank you everyone for uh joining the

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,520
magnet seminars this week

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,440
um and it's another another uh good

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,200
turnout so thank you very much for the

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,000
community support and just a very quick

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,440
reminder

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,119
about the uh seminar formats we have a

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,320
20 25 to 30 minute presentation i kindly

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,920
ask that everybody keeps their

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,000
microphones muted so it's not to

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
interrupt the presenter

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,119
um following that we'll have a 10-15

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
minute

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
uh question and answer session and we'll

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,440
invite you to on your microphones and

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,920
ask an oral question

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,559
if you don't want to to ask a question

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,960
um

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,079
in person you can add the question to

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
the chat

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
if you just simply put no mic then

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
either myself or one of the co-hosts

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
we'll be able to uh read out the

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,680
question for you

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,520
um and as always if you have to just get

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,920
up and go halfway through the seminars

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,760
please

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
just get up and go we've got life going

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,120
on all around us

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
and at the end of the session we'll have

31
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
time for a bit of a catch up with

32
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,399
everybody

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,159
and that part of the seminar will not be

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,680
will not be recorded so it's a

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,280
bit more of a relaxed environment and so

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,310
today our speaker i'll hand over to our

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
speaker adrian

38
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,400
[Music]

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
who will be presenting on diagenesis and

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,040
magnetic

41
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
signals of hydrocarbons

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,640
good hopefully you can see my screen now

43
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,280
um okay so major maxwell from piro

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
college

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,680
um i run the natural magnetism group and

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,600
i'll be talking about work that we've

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
been doing over the last decade and it's

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,840
something i've not really talked about

49
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,280
personally with this community some of

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,880
my students over the years have done

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,320
that but i haven't

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,200
given a talk on this particular topic to

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
uh this of the paleomonetic community or

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
geometric community

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,119
um so this is works been done with um

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,079
alfresa who's

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,680
worked for bp for i guess about 30 years

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
in exploration and now he's works at

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
university

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,360
uh mark sefton who's a organic

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,560
geochemist

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,680
and with a range of former and

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,879
current uh phd students your names are

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,560
up there on the screen you might have

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,360
met some of them at various meetings

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,319
over the

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,720
last few years so i'm going to be

68
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,760
talking about the magnetic signature of

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,480
uh hydrocarbons

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,040
um now we're not the first people to do

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,840
that and i guess the sort of first

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,879
motivational paper came out in 1917 i'm

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
not going to spend too long talking

74
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,360
about the history of this but just a

75
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,879
little bit to give some

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,920
idea of the motivation um

77
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,080
the first paper came out in 1979 where a

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,879
paper by donovan who did an aeromagnetic

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,879
survey

80
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
over an oil field called cement field

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,360
i'm not quite sure why it's called

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,720
cement field in oklahoma and

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,720
they detected magnetic anomalies so

84
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,239
i've got the sort of mineral or rot

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
magnetism interested in what might be

86
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,480
causing

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,480
that and over the last few decades a

88
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,239
number of

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,519
academics from various places around the

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,080
world particularly people like doc

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
elmore

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
groups in venezuela they've looked

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
trying to link

94
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
magnetic anomalies trying to understand

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
these magnetic anomalies

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,959
and trying to tie them to hydrocarbons

97
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,680
so here we've got this study from

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
from 2000 from the group in venezuela

99
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
and they've got

100
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,840
three cores um

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,599
the two on the left are above

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,480
hydrocarbon reservoirs and the one on

103
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,280
the

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
one on the the right is not and you can

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
see there's these

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,879
these spikes in the susceptibility and

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,760
the the values substability are much

108
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
higher

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,680
so there's clearly sort of some kind of

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,720
link going on between

111
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,360
the presence of hydrocarbons in in the

112
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
ground

113
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,200
and the magnetic uh magnetization the

114
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
magnetic signal of rocks

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
um it's been documented for a long time

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,720
now there's a picture from dog elmo from

117
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,319
987 you get these

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,840
wonderful framboids of iron oxides and

119
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,519
iron sulfides

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
and he who's we've got a picture on the

121
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,560
right taken by a former student

122
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,799
of mine stacy emerton and this is on the

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
on the one of the riders of a nice

124
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,320
framboid of

125
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,519
of of gregite um

126
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,919
and this is another sort of uh magnetic

127
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
uh

128
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,040
response that we kind of see in

129
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,600
association with hydrocarbons

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,040
in addition to that uh uh hans mackel

131
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,360
who's one of our collaborators

132
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
and liz burton did a whole bunch of

133
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,919
thermodynamic modeling

134
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,199
in the early to mid 90s where they

135
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,479
looked at

136
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,040
iron oxides and sulfides and cellulite

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,800
in the presence of various hydrocarbon

138
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
systems at a range of depths and

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
pressures and they showed how the

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,400
different minerals

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,160
would form and change depending on the

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,440
conditions so there's a whole

143
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,080
wealth of background um

144
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
in literature before we started looking

145
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
at this

146
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
problem okay so i'm not starting from

147
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,199
scratch or

148
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
one of the things even though there's

149
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
been a lot of work done there wasn't

150
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,199
really a

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,560
clear link between the magnetometer and

152
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,000
the hydrocarbons have been various

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,360
studies but they're often

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,919
related to various kind of aspects

155
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,600
of uh you know being case studies so see

156
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,800
some trends in one place but we can see

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
in the other place and we want to try

158
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
and

159
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,120
make something a bit more unified and

160
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,000
then can we use these magnetic signals

161
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,160
as a proxy to understand hydrocarbon

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,960
systems

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
so we're going to talk i'm not going to

164
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,720
talk too much about sort of background

165
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,039
geology but just a little bit here

166
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,400
um what how does oil form if you have a

167
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,039
sediment that's full of

168
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,919
organic material it gets buried when it

169
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,720
gets down to about

170
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,720
three kilometers or so starts to form

171
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,520
into oil if you go deeper it forms into

172
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
gas

173
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,000
of course oil and gas a light molecule

174
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
so they want to

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,840
go up so they try and escape from where

176
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
the deep places and go

177
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,120
go upwards towards the surface so they

178
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,160
then migrate

179
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,639
along through typically um

180
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,479
porous rock plastic rocks like sandstone

181
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,120
until they get trapped by an impermeable

182
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
layer

183
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
and you get a range of different kinds

184
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
of traps you can have anti-klein's

185
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,360
faults there's a whole range of

186
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680
different types of traps and of course

187
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
the

188
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,720
the gas is lighter than the oil so you

189
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,280
tend to get gas on the top and you get

190
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
oil

191
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,639
and underneath you typically get maybe

192
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
get some water so you get these

193
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,000
different types of contacts and i'll be

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,520
talking about contacts a little bit

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,720
later on so this is the kind of system

196
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,479
we're looking at

197
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
we also have to worry about

198
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,880
biodegradation of the oil because this

199
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,280
has been shown to affect the magnetic

200
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,560
mineralogy so

201
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,319
as the oil gets towards the surface so

202
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,560
as the temperature drops below about 80

203
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
degrees celsius and impossible for

204
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,599
bacteria

205
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
to live they they quite like this

206
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,000
hydrocarbons and they

207
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,360
they essentially destroy it they degrade

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
the quality of it

209
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,520
and in the process some of these

210
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,599
bacteria can produce

211
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,800
magnetite particles as in this picture

212
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,080
here and some of them

213
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,599
can destroy the magnetization so it's

214
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,759
something else we need to consider when

215
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,039
we're looking at the magnetic response

216
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,720
of a hydrocarbon system

217
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,240
now i'm going to talk about some

218
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
examples of some work that we've done

219
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
and i

220
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,199
i didn't this is only the second time

221
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
i've been to one of these talks and i

222
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,000
haven't realized it's only supposed to

223
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,080
be 25 minutes so i might

224
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
just cut off just do the first three

225
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,319
bits and

226
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
take then go on to the end okay so

227
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
all these are the things that we these

228
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,639
are the sort of things we've been doing

229
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,599
over the last 10 years at imperial

230
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
and what we're going to do is we're

231
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,240
going to start off with the oral kitchen

232
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,599
this is the part

233
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,280
where the oil um

234
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,919
forms okay so if we're going to use

235
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,759
magnetization as a proxy we need to have

236
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,720
some kind of idea

237
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,400
um how these magnetic particles are

238
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,520
being formed are they being formed as

239
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,639
the fluid

240
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,000
uh passes through the rock some sort of

241
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
so that minerals are formed

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,479
in situ in place or are they actually

243
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,680
transported

244
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,919
with the oil itself so we did a series

245
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,479
of paralysis experiments to see if oil

246
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,479
if

247
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,560
when oil forms where the magnetic

248
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,199
particles form as well and whether these

249
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,479
particles

250
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,599
are small enough to be transported with

251
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,800
the oil so paralysis is essentially what

252
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,400
we're doing is

253
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
we're reproducing what we see in the

254
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
environment we're creating pressures and

255
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,960
temperatures which are

256
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,159
enough to generate um oil so we're going

257
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,039
to essentially going to make oil in the

258
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
lab

259
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,800
and this is this process is called

260
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,200
paralysis and to do that we need

261
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
we need a source rock so we're quite

262
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,680
lucky in

263
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,039
london which is just about here that

264
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,959
we're about two hours drive from the

265
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,279
wessex basin which is the

266
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,480
probably the best example of an onshore

267
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,600
um oil

268
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,200
uh hydrocarbon system in europe so

269
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,320
people not just people from uk but

270
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
people from elsewhere

271
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,200
will come to this this area to study

272
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,360
hydrocarbon systems

273
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
and if you go down to the beaches all

274
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,399
the way along the beach here you get the

275
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,160
sandstone outcrops

276
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,040
and you can see you can see all this

277
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,080
all this uh the sand here the sandstone

278
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,640
and if you look at this you probably

279
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,399
think this is

280
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
wet and it is wet but it's actually all

281
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,720
oil if you actually go there the oil is

282
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
literally just

283
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
dribbling out of the rocks at the side

284
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,120
there it's so rich and all now

285
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,320
clearly if we wanted immature sauce walk

286
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,680
rock we want some of the rock that

287
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,680
hasn't actually been buried or isn't

288
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,160
contaminated by the oil so obviously

289
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
we've got our immature sauce rolled from

290
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,279
somewhere else but

291
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
it's this famous kimridge clay and blue

292
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,839
lyrics and oxford clay which are full

293
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,040
of organic content and we made oil in

294
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
the laboratory

295
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,959
now we haven't got geological time

296
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,000
scales so we have to cheat a little bit

297
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,839
and by cheating

298
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
we have to speed up the reaction to

299
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,480
speed up the reaction we go to higher

300
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
temperatures so

301
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,920
in nature this would typically be

302
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,200
happening at 100 degrees say or

303
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
something like that

304
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
we went up to 200 degrees to see what

305
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,959
happens to the magnetization

306
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
to generate magnetic properties on a

307
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,760
time scale

308
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,399
which is uh more you know more human so

309
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
we can

310
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,680
three or four days is typically what

311
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,480
we're looking at so

312
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,079
here we have hysteresis loops of a

313
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
sample so we've taken the unheated

314
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,920
sample as a history

315
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,120
you can't really see it because there's

316
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
nothing to see it's completely flat

317
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
there's no magnesium whatsoever

318
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640
then when we did the paralysis

319
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
experiment at 250 degrees

320
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
we generated this curve here so we've

321
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
generated all these ferromagnetic

322
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
minerals

323
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,560
and when we did it at even higher

324
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,079
temperature we find that we had

325
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,680
even more uh well with different type of

326
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
magnetic minerals we're at slightly high

327
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,640
temperature now i should stress that

328
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,399
these are at artificially high

329
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
temperatures so that potentially the

330
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
minerals that we're producing

331
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
might not be exactly the same as what

332
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,120
might happen

333
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,880
in nature because we're doing these at

334
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,600
artificially high temperatures but the

335
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,839
idea is

336
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,760
that magnetic particles can be generated

337
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,320
so here we have a graph

338
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,480
of saturation magnetization from the

339
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
hysteresis loops

340
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
and this is the this is the unheated

341
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
immature sample

342
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,399
this is ms for three different source

343
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
rocks immature rocks

344
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,240
and this is the the response and these

345
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,519
are the temperatures at which we did

346
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,440
the paralysis and so here we have these

347
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,880
iron sulfide minerals when you go to a

348
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
certain level at 300 you're going to

349
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,720
drop to zero but then

350
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,000
above that we start producing iron oxide

351
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,200
minerals so clearly

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,800
we can produce this um

353
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,079
produce lots of magnetic minerals and

354
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,839
when we try and measure the magnetic

355
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,800
properties to try and get an idea of the

356
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
grain size

357
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,160
we see that we have lots and lots of

358
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
very very small

359
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
eliminated particles of the order of 30

360
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,360
nanometers now you might think we've

361
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,880
only got small particles

362
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
because we've done these experiments

363
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,519
very quickly and in nature because

364
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,279
you've got more time you end up with

365
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,760
much larger particles

366
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,440
but as you'll see later on these very

367
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,279
small particles of the order of 30

368
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,360
nanometers or less than 30 million are

369
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,519
very very typical in the natural systems

370
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,360
as well

371
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,959
just to verify that we have these very

372
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,720
small particles we did some transmission

373
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,360
electron microscopy

374
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,480
and we managed to find quite a lot of

375
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,240
these little

376
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,279
uh nanoparticles is 20 nanometers i

377
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,320
think this was a

378
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,320
an iron sulfide

379
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,240
mineral so this was part of uh

380
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
a piece using red used phd thesis and

381
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
then we showed this accelerated

382
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,360
paralysis produces these nanoparticles

383
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
and these nanoparticles importantly

384
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,200
are small enough to pass through the

385
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,040
pore spaces

386
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
in a typical sandstone so typically

387
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
you're looking at things less than 100

388
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,920
nanometers so 13 less than 30 nanometers

389
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,320
is much less than this critical limit so

390
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,760
the potential for the the magnetic

391
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,680
particles to be generated in the old

392
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,680
kitchen actually to migrate with the oil

393
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,760
itself

394
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,160
later on another phd student of mine

395
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
shopping was keen to test the idea that

396
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
the

397
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,800
oil part these magnetic particles

398
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,560
actually within the oil so he got a

399
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
he got some samples from the the north

400
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,959
sea and this is an area i'll be talking

401
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,200
about a little bit

402
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,320
uh further later on we'll talk about his

403
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,399
phd work

404
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,720
um but i thought i'd just bring this in

405
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,600
now so we had a pure oil

406
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
sample from the north sea he wanted to

407
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
mix it

408
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,480
in something so we could measure it so

409
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,920
we mixed it in this kayla night clay

410
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
and you can see this is the background

411
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,480
signal and when we put the oil in the

412
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,399
can like clay measured

413
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
on a on a squid magnetometer and did low

414
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,360
temperature magnetometry

415
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,959
you can see we've got these different

416
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,880
minerals but the main thing to see is

417
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,560
that the magnetization is significantly

418
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,079
higher we've got values of

419
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,839
roughly 100 times higher in the oil

420
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,279
sample so the oil samples are able to

421
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,519
actually contain

422
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,560
the magnetic particle phases when you're

423
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,560
off this size

424
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,160
okay so one of the main things we've

425
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,480
been doing over

426
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,880
the last um five or six years is trying

427
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,720
to see if we can use

428
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,920
this magnetic signal to track migration

429
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,760
now micro hydrocarbon migration in oil

430
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,440
reservoirs is actually something that's

431
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,160
quite hard to do

432
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,360
and a lot of actually all companies and

433
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
et cetera they're just more interested

434
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
in fighting with the oil is they're not

435
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,399
always that particular about how the oil

436
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,399
actually gets there

437
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,760
now if you want to increase yield from

438
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,519
mature

439
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,959
oil fields and then it's

440
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,639
probably a very good idea to understand

441
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,360
the migration so rather than

442
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,040
having to explore and exploit new oil

443
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,399
fields and new parts of the world

444
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,920
you can keep um extracting oil from

445
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,320
existing oil fields so

446
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,519
understanding migration is quite a key

447
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,560
uh

448
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,720
problem uh to try and tackle so we've

449
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,800
kind of shown that nanoparticles can

450
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,160
probably migrate

451
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,480
and also there's lots of uh literature

452
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
to

453
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
suggest that the hydrocarbons themselves

454
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
as they pass through

455
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,959
create a diagenesis front which also

456
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,880
causes the formation

457
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,800
of magnetic minerals so these thromboids

458
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,880
that we see are obviously too big

459
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,040
to be uh transported with the

460
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,240
hydrocarbons

461
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,839
so because this um

462
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,839
got a bit longer here i thought i would

463
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,040
just talk about our first attempt to do

464
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,000
this which wasn't particularly

465
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,279
successful

466
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,199
and i'll tell you why i wasn't

467
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,240
successful then i'll talk about more

468
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
successful

469
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,560
study so this wessex basin which i

470
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,320
discussed already so this is where

471
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,959
london is and this is slightly down to

472
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,360
the

473
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,839
the west of uh on the south coast of

474
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,079
england to the west of london

475
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,120
and what we're interested in doing is

476
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,279
can we

477
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,240
take cores so can we take material from

478
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,079
this hydrocarbon system determine the

479
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,120
migration path independently using the

480
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,880
magnetics

481
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,199
and then try and determine the migration

482
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,240
path using

483
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,360
uh 3d seismic sorry

484
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,880
3d basin modeling based on 3d seismic

485
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,759
data that's the kind of idea so we get

486
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
an independent

487
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,759
estimate of migration can the magnetics

488
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,000
match up that's what we're trying to do

489
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,160
right so the first thing we need to do

490
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
is to get a location with core

491
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,600
and we was working we were working on

492
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
the wessex basins that was obviously the

493
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,839
first place to

494
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,759
that we thought we would try and we're

495
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,839
very lucky in the uk that

496
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,000
i don't know since when it's the 60s or

497
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,440
70 every single core that's been drilled

498
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,040
anywhere in the uk

499
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,120
on land or offshore half of it has to go

500
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,160
half of the core has to go to the

501
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,320
government and it's stored at the

502
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,160
british geological survey in nottingham

503
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,680
and as an academic we've got free access

504
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
to all of this so we can just

505
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,360
go up we can take samples it's a

506
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,079
fantastic resource we're very lucky to

507
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
have it

508
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,279
i know some other countries have this

509
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
but not all countries have this

510
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,440
this resource and so we have a picture

511
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,639
here on the left we have some sandstorm

512
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,680
which was from

513
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,040
not uh it's a water wet so there wasn't

514
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
any oil on this and you can see here

515
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,720
we've got oil stains you can see it

516
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,199
looks very very different

517
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
okay so this is uh so we go up there we

518
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,519
have all these different

519
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,720
um these where the different cores and

520
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,160
we get all these different materials

521
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,519
allows us to do

522
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,079
look at the uh the magnetism we also

523
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,320
have to

524
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,560
find an area where they've done the 3d

525
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,319
uh seismic data has been collected in

526
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
here just showing you the 3d seismic

527
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,919
data for this particular area that we're

528
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,079
interested in

529
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
now later on i'll be talking about how

530
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,199
we get to the magnetic results but we

531
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
use a suite of magnetic tools low

532
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,240
temperature high temperature and for

533
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,319
this particular study i just want to

534
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,600
jump straight into the results now this

535
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,640
was a particularly

536
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,079
it was quite a hard hard kind of study

537
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
and trying to interpret the data it was

538
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,000
quite complex and

539
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,919
in places it was uh quite difficult to

540
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,679
interpret but um

541
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,840
just taking the average of each of these

542
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,600
particular cores we're able to

543
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,840
kind of get a trend for the general

544
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,640
behavior now we'll be talking later on

545
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,799
about

546
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,080
how you get variations of magnetization

547
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
along the core but right here we just

548
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,960
talked about this

549
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
average behavior so we we think the oil

550
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
is coming out we know the oil is

551
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
formed that kim ridge is coming up and

552
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,400
then migrating to which farm

553
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,840
and we was kind of sure from the

554
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
magnetics that it doesn't go through

555
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,520
bushy farm that was previously thought

556
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,360
and actually kind of went around it

557
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,120
over in this region here we have so this

558
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
is the magnetite signal the yellow is

559
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,679
the

560
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,799
periodic signal the green is this mixed

561
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,880
response

562
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,160
over here it was quite complex and

563
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
difficult to interpret

564
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,520
but anyway we kind of thought for the

565
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,320
magnetics even though the result wasn't

566
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,919
100

567
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,679
clear that there was some sort of

568
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,240
migration power so the idea is could we

569
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,520
tie that

570
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:24,640
in with the uh 3d basin modeling

571
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,000
and this is the upheaval map for the

572
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
area and

573
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,559
some of you probably not very familiar

574
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
with these things i'm not going to go

575
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,000
into great detail on the 3d basin

576
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,120
modeling but basically

577
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,559
it's not a particularly uh it's not a

578
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,720
particularly great example of an

579
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,000
upheaval mate just it was very complex

580
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
and it was very difficult to do the

581
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,880
modeling

582
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,640
and even though there's a hint of a

583
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,840
migration path here

584
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
so this is the king ridge where it's

585
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,400
come up and this is the this is the

586
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,360
which farm where

587
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,960
we think the with the oil reservoir is

588
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,880
um it wasn't very clear from the

589
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
modeling and unfortunately it wasn't

590
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
it wasn't good enough to be a control

591
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,080
and the reason for that is not so much

592
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
in rabbi who is a phd student it was

593
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,880
more the fact

594
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,400
and his supervisors chose a location

595
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,919
that probably wasn't the best place to

596
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,280
test the theory on so here we have the

597
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,360
wessex basin

598
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
this is the area we're working in around

599
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
about here and it's very very complex

600
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,799
lots of uh inversions anti-clients

601
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
inclines it's a very difficult

602
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,559
place to work and probably not the best

603
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,160
place to test our migration

604
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
theory using magnetic so we decided to

605
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,280
try

606
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
simple locality and this is where

607
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,919
shoppies

608
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,120
phd is and we choose a place in the

609
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,960
north sea

610
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,360
and we've chosen this locality the tay

611
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,760
fan which has a very linear system so

612
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,000
the oil is being formed over here

613
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,000
and then it migrates along in a straight

614
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
line along this direction so we've kind

615
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
of got

616
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,120
a relatively simple geology we think and

617
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,880
we've got a nice linear simple system

618
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,520
it's a fill and spill chain this is kind

619
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
of what we

620
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,080
thought we go to and we've also got

621
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,480
access to lots of 3d seismic data and

622
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,440
good core coverage so that was our

623
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
reason for

624
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,480
attempting this area and so here just in

625
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,039
slightly more detail here this is the

626
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
oil is coming here here on the side and

627
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,200
moving along

628
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,799
in this direction and this is the

629
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
schematic of what it originally looked

630
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,440
like

631
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,960
so we're starting down here in the oil

632
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,840
is migrating up

633
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,679
the upper along this upper tail fan up

634
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,679
through here

635
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,960
okay and these are the various names of

636
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
various oil fields

637
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
in the north sea

638
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
okay so i'm going to show some seismic

639
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,559
data which

640
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,480
you probably don't you guys probably

641
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,679
don't really look at very much i'm not

642
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,120
going to talk too much about it it's

643
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,640
more just to show this is kind of the

644
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
system we're looking at

645
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,679
and we started we thought we had a nice

646
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,679
linear system so we started off looking

647
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,240
at the 2d seismic models

648
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,320
um the idea is the oil forms over here

649
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,840
and it moves up and migrates along here

650
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,360
unfortunately it was all getting stuck

651
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
on this salt dome

652
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,200
and of course the world isn't a 2d model

653
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,960
it's a 3d model

654
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
and rather than we couldn't in the model

655
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,919
get the oil to go over the salt dome but

656
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,679
of course in real world it just goes

657
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,400
around it okay so

658
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,320
using a 2d model doesn't always work so

659
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,080
we had to resort to 3d models

660
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,679
and the 3d models is really quite a lot

661
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
of work this is

662
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,200
the work the students have done with

663
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,120
their other supervisor alfreso

664
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,039
i'm not going to talk about the the 3d

665
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,880
basin modeling in great detail

666
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,240
just just going to show you the results

667
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
there's a lot of work going on to these

668
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,559
models

669
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,760
and here you can see this this is

670
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,200
the final model i'm going to be talking

671
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
about this later on but this is just the

672
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,440
starting point

673
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,280
so here we have the tay sandstone

674
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,640
here we have the predicted oil

675
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,400
accumulations and here we have the

676
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
migration pass this is what the 3d

677
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,960
models allows us to do

678
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,600
and we are running these solutions now

679
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
on the hp

680
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,159
just to show they look quite tricky to

681
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,960
do we're running them on the hbc

682
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,520
facilities

683
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,720
to actually get these uh solved

684
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,080
so that's the that's the basic modeling

685
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,799
aspect and of course we want to tie that

686
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,480
in with the

687
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,240
magnetics and we do the whole range of

688
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,600
the usual experiments low temperature

689
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,799
experiments

690
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,880
um now the low temperature experiments

691
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,840
students have limited access to mpms

692
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,760
because we

693
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,120
don't have an mpms we managed to get an

694
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,600
npms in january 2019

695
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,200
and yesterday our the engineer from

696
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,799
quantum design was there and he said

697
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,039
it's working but we've not had any data

698
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,880
from

699
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,039
in 18 months so it's been one big

700
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,360
disappointment getting the npms

701
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,760
luckily other people have been very uh

702
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,760
other places around the world be very

703
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,360
helpful in letting us get access to

704
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,559
their npms systems like

705
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,480
anu and the irm etc

706
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,919
so that the low temperature data is

707
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
really crucial to try and understand

708
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,280
what's going on

709
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,360
but as we all know magnetic data doesn't

710
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,799
rely on one particular measurement

711
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,559
relies on a whole range of different

712
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,000
types of measurements so

713
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,600
we we do a lot of high temperature

714
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,799
measurements high temp receptability

715
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
measurements which can be

716
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,320
difficult to interpret because the

717
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
minerals are altering as we

718
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,400
heat them up we also do a lot of

719
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,240
electron microscopy now the

720
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,720
the magnetizations are relatively weak

721
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,400
they're down at um

722
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,679
parts per hundred thousand maybe parts

723
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
per million so we can't really do

724
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,200
electron microscopy work

725
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,200
on the samples as they are we have to do

726
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,520
a magnetic extraction which obviously

727
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,039
potentially leads to issues because you

728
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,240
may be not extracting all the magnetic

729
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,320
minerals of interest

730
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,080
and then we're able to do some electron

731
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,240
microscopy and we're able to try and

732
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,960
differentiate between greg atom

733
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,880
or peritonite and identify minerals like

734
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
pyrite etc

735
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
so this is just we've got hundreds of

736
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,640
these uh examples of

737
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,919
measurements we've also been doing for

738
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,679
measurements but as the samples are

739
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,080
particularly weak it's quite difficult

740
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,080
to get

741
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
four measurements along with relatively

742
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,440
incomplete data sets for the fork data

743
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
but just to show the kind of typical

744
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,480
behavior that we get

745
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,880
and for this particular study shopee was

746
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
able to

747
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,919
summarize all the data these are the

748
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,840
different minerals that we

749
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,279
found um we identified the origins

750
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,360
whether they're the trital so

751
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,600
they're originally whether they formed

752
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,760
in the presence of hydrocarbons

753
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,120
um and whether so essentially whether

754
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,679
they're a background signal

755
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,520
or product of the hydrocarbons we also

756
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,440
get quite a lot of machemite

757
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,760
as we suspect a lot of the magnemite

758
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,320
comes from the cores being stored in air

759
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
for

760
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,760
potentially 30 years so those little

761
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,279
magnetite particles

762
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,640
get oxidized okay so those are the kind

763
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,760
of systems we're looking at so the

764
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
minerals that are particularly of

765
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,279
interest are the

766
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,279
cidarite and the gregite as we'll see in

767
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,000
the next couple of slides

768
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,760
so when we plot them on a map so this is

769
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,600
uh the area that we're looking at before

770
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,679
the gray area marks the area where we

771
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,559
have the 3d seismic data that's just why

772
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,080
that's just showing

773
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,360
the 3d seismic data area we have the the

774
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,039
wells and each of the wells has

775
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,039
different colors so the dark red is the

776
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,080
hydrocarbon producing wells

777
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,840
the the the slightly brighters of ready

778
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,760
orange ones here

779
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,559
these have got oil in them but maybe not

780
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,480
enough to actually go to full production

781
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,600
then we have the dry well core we've

782
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,120
only got one of these this

783
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,279
gives us our background signal this is

784
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,039
particularly important

785
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,799
because we need to know the background

786
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,120
signal of our rocks now

787
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,400
unfortunately oil companies don't drill

788
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,440
many background

789
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,039
cores because they're looking for

790
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
hydrocarbons so generally speaking you

791
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,320
don't get many

792
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,320
sort of dry wells we do get these

793
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,360
drywall cuttings sometimes like up here

794
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
this yellow one

795
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,760
unfortunately these cuttings tend to be

796
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,360
mixed up with drilling modern stuff so

797
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,640
it's they're often contaminated so you

798
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,159
can't really rely

799
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,080
on the drywall cuttings you really have

800
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,840
to rely on the drywall core

801
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
to get a fairly good background so we

802
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,360
think our background signal here is

803
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,320
magnetite okay so this is

804
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,000
then here this is magnetite here so here

805
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,279
we have the oil coming upwards and we've

806
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,440
kind of got

807
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,360
sharpies kind of colored this according

808
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
to the main mineralogy so this area here

809
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,840
is all kind of

810
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,240
mostly dark green so this means it's

811
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,919
cinderites mostly

812
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,440
and as we move along here we kind of

813
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,440
start getting so

814
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,080
equal numbers of of uh iron sulphides

815
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,080
and cellulite and then here we've got

816
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,799
much more iron sulfides so that's kind

817
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,919
of our

818
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:09,200
our trend now

819
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,960
let's just jump back to the 3d model

820
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,320
so our 3d model predicted these oil

821
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,039
accumulations

822
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,640
now it didn't actually match what we see

823
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,080
in the real world

824
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,559
and there was kind of a problem there so

825
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,159
um sharpie was trying so choppy was

826
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,600
doing this at the same time so it's kind

827
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,960
of iterative process they're not

828
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,960
supposed to be done independently but

829
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,520
it's done by the same person so clearly

830
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,559
the person has got both data sets in

831
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,520
their head

832
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,120
and what he noticed was that we a lot of

833
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,640
pseudoright where we potentially might

834
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,080
have

835
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,240
vertical migration so he associated

836
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,880
the sidorite with this protocol

837
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,279
migration so essentially when oil

838
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,400
as it rises up you get decompression

839
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,120
that releases

840
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,480
bicarbonate which has the potential

841
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,480
potential to

842
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,880
to form then they've got all this extra

843
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,520
carbon oxygen potential to form with the

844
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,360
iron

845
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,120
to form pseudorite you don't get that

846
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,880
when you're doing lateral migration so

847
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,799
he associated with this with vertical

848
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,799
migration and this

849
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,679
iron suffers with with um horizontal or

850
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,640
lateral

851
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,159
migration but there wasn't really in the

852
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
model itself there wasn't really

853
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,120
anywhere

854
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,559
for this vertical migration to occur so

855
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,080
he went back

856
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,000
and at the same time another student

857
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,559
mary was just starting her phd

858
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,320
and she had in her course in a similar

859
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,200
region very close to here

860
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,120
she had lots of injections essentially

861
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,120
bands of sandstone which are kind of

862
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,919
have gone through um the impermeable lab

863
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,520
above which allow the oil to migrate now

864
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,399
here's a picture of these injectors in

865
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,840
the cores

866
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,240
okay and you can see the scale here

867
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,919
these are 10 centimeters or so

868
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,320
right so the scale of this is probably

869
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,640
less than a meter or meter or less

870
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,640
now the depth of the depth we're working

871
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,640
at the seismic resolution is about

872
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,320
10 meters so essentially we've got all

873
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,080
these little injectites

874
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,320
that are too small to be seen with the

875
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,000
size mix but you can see them in the

876
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,679
cause and the mineral magnetism is

877
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,440
suggesting they should be there so

878
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,799
there's gonna a link there

879
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,799
and choppy went back and he had a look

880
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,360
at his seismic data in detail and he got

881
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,600
hints of potentially some injectites

882
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,760
in his seismic data and that only came

883
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,520
about because of the mineral magnetism

884
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,399
so the idea of having this independent

885
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,080
technique

886
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,240
we ended up using the magnetism to help

887
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,679
interpret and fully interpret

888
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,520
the 3d model so he put the injection

889
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,960
built his 3d model so put the injectors

890
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,720
into the 3d model

891
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,600
and lo behold they got something that

892
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,159
matches more what's going on in reality

893
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,120
so that was rather than using the 3d

894
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,559
basin to test

895
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,799
test the the mineral magnetic migrations

896
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,600
theory we ended up using them in my

897
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,880
mineral magnetic migration sort of ideas

898
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,919
to fine-tune

899
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,640
the the basin model which was

900
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,159
very pleasing for me um so here's kind

901
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,520
of a summary of what was going on

902
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,360
back to our 2d case so here we have the

903
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,000
the injectites over here we have this

904
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,080
migration going up here this forms

905
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,880
all the side right we saw the

906
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,640
predominant magnetic signal

907
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,080
signating all these cores and as it

908
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,120
transports along

909
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,840
we tend to get less sederites more iron

910
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,360
sulfide so we get all the way over here

911
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,760
the oil creeps through here we end up

912
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,840
with a a much more gragate or iron

913
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,240
sulfide like

914
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,640
signal now

915
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,720
you might say lateral migrations purely

916
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,640
gives an iron sulfide signal but also

917
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,159
we're running into this eye area where

918
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,440
it's getting quite shallow so now we

919
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,960
need to start thinking of fire

920
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,320
degradation

921
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,440
so as i said before biodegradation

922
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,720
happens due to bacteria at relatively

923
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
shallow

924
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,360
depths so relatively cool temperatures

925
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,159
below 80 degrees celsius

926
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,520
so over here we've got the oil vertical

927
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,200
migration forming

928
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,600
our acidorites and as it comes through

929
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,880
here it's coming into the zone where

930
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,640
we're starting getting lots of iron

931
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,760
sulfides but we also

932
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,919
this red here is an indication of the

933
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,279
so i should mention this this map here

934
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,159
is a is a graph

935
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,840
is the api gravity and the api gravity

936
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
is very strongly correlated with the

937
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,279
level of biodegradation so here we've

938
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,279
over the blue we've got

939
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,559
no uh biodegradable very low by

940
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,080
degradation and where it's red we've got

941
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,679
lots of biodegradation

942
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,279
it's a very crude way of getting the

943
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,799
biodegradation level

944
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,320
and you can see that we've got lots of

945
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,760
iron sulfides when it's lots of

946
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,520
biodegradation so

947
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,360
is it due to lateral migration or is it

948
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,279
due to biodegradation

949
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,399
now fortunately before that we had

950
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,080
another student

951
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,480
stacy who looked a lot at by degradation

952
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,480
in her

953
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,679
in her thesis and

954
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,360
she got samples from various places

955
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,640
around the world

956
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,840
um so we've got the alberta

957
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,159
tar sands columbia colombia indonesia

958
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,080
and the uk

959
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,760
and she did the usual magnetic analysis

960
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,799
i know running over time here a little

961
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,640
bit

962
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,760
uh but she also did a lot of organic

963
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,159
uh geochemistry so looking at

964
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,519
um fourier transform infrared

965
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,279
spectroscopy

966
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,440
and gas chromatography to try and

967
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,760
quantify the oil in these samples and

968
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,399
trying to understand the levels of

969
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,000
biodegradation

970
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,760
these graphs for some reason never have

971
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,360
units on there's always response versus

972
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,440
retention time i've asked

973
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,960
the the organic geochemist why they

974
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,559
never put units on is well there aren't

975
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,519
any units and i've never got a

976
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,960
clear answer to what the units are but

977
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,600
so before anyone criticized me for no

978
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,039
units i

979
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,360
would also like to know where the units

980
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,480
are on this particular graph

981
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,440
um this allows us to

982
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,120
plot the samples and sort by degradation

983
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,519
plot there's various ways of measuring

984
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,039
the

985
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,120
biodegradation we can see there's

986
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,399
various samples from the various

987
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,799
localities from over here where there's

988
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,640
almost

989
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,840
no biodegradation that very high levels

990
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,559
of biodegradation

991
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,159
uh the analysis uh of so for stacey for

992
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,840
her work she did a lot of

993
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,840
election microscopy we saw a lot of

994
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,600
these fanboys we also saw

995
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,360
evidence for microbe activity i mean she

996
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,279
associated this with

997
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,720
biodegradation and there is is some

998
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,320
evidence work but i think the

999
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,840
biodegradation is really happening on a

1000
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,919
much smaller scale

1001
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,519
than we're looking at in this particular

1002
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,360
crystal here which is quite a large

1003
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,960
crystal

1004
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,200
and she was able to come up with a very

1005
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,760
nice graph so we've got the two graphs

1006
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
two independent ways of measuring by the

1007
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,159
by degradation and these graphs are

1008
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,720
essentially

1009
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,440
the same even though they're plotted we

1010
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
look

1011
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,559
contrasting so the levels of

1012
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
biodegradation on the left

1013
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,880
one are going up as we go this way and

1014
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,039
on the the right hand side is going down

1015
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,240
and along here we have the magnetic

1016
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,519
acceptability

1017
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,840
so we just look at the one on the left

1018
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,919
here so as biodegradation

1019
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,760
increases this log because this is minus

1020
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,399
is 10 to the minus six ten to the minus

1021
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,880
five

1022
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,600
the magnetization is decreasing right so

1023
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,120
higher

1024
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:09,760
biodegradation um lower magnetization

1025
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,480
and she was interested in tying this in

1026
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,440
to

1027
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,679
the uh to this idea of doing

1028
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,720
aeromagnetic surface so

1029
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,840
she uh the idea that we came up with as

1030
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,440
a biodegradation

1031
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,360
leads to preferential removal of the

1032
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,640
smaller magnetic particles so what we

1033
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,760
found was that the grain size

1034
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,440
distribution

1035
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,799
also shifts so even though we reduce the

1036
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,519
magnetization it's the very small

1037
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,760
particles

1038
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,360
are the ones that are removed first

1039
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,559
preferentially leaving

1040
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,799
the larger particles

1041
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,320
now in the work that she does she came

1042
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,679
up with lots of

1043
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,320
all her work suggested that the

1044
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,320
particles were left over with magnetite

1045
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,399
and in the work that was done by shoppi

1046
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,919
it came we came across that we actually

1047
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,279
ended with lots of iron sulfide so it

1048
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,320
seems to be a little bit of a

1049
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,240
contradiction there however i think

1050
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,919
this probably depends a lot exactly the

1051
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,880
depth of which the biodegradation is

1052
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,960
happening

1053
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,080
um as you can see here from a paper from

1054
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,840
andrew roberts

1055
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,519
you can see that depending exactly where

1056
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,799
we're on this graph

1057
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,399
where they're in the soft sulfide

1058
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,320
reductions on the iron reduction zone

1059
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,200
we're going to get a different response

1060
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,359
so i think with in the light of the work

1061
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,200
that of shopee's phd thesis we need to

1062
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,240
go back and revisit the biodegradation

1063
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,320
work we did

1064
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,800
with stacey so many years ago

1065
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,480
so to be continued now i realize i kind

1066
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,720
of run over time so

1067
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,560
um i'm just going to skip this is no

1068
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,919
point also quite so important this is

1069
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,919
just about some of the micro related

1070
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,440
modeling we've done on framboids that we

1071
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:40,240
see

1072
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:43,839
and then i also we also find this at the

1073
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,919
fluid water contacts so the oil

1074
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,119
water contacts and the gas contacts we

1075
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,560
often get the spike in the magnetization

1076
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,480
um so you're going down the core you get

1077
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,520
these spikes and we're able to identify

1078
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,960
the contacts using um

1079
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,599
other techniques like looking at things

1080
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,079
like porosity and we are still trying to

1081
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,400
kind of

1082
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,760
come get a coherent method for

1083
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
explaining how

1084
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,640
uh why you get this enhancement

1085
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,240
so i'm just gonna go through those so

1086
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,920
just to wrap it up so normally i would

1087
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,280
leave a slide with conclusions but i

1088
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,800
thought i would leave

1089
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,240
the finishing slide to talk about

1090
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,000
the work that we're currently doing so

1091
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,480
still got three phd students i should

1092
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,720
still

1093
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,200
we've got three phd students working

1094
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,359
this area so we're trying to look at can

1095
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
magnetic migration work the analysis

1096
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,079
that we've done does it work on a

1097
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,320
reservoir scale so we've kind of

1098
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,920
done it on a large scale hydrocarbon

1099
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,200
system but can we do it on an individual

1100
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,640
reservoir scale that's something

1101
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,480
mariam's working on

1102
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,800
we have another ph.d student joe and

1103
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,400
he's looking at um

1104
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
in the murray firth and he's got oil

1105
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
from different sources and can we use

1106
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
the mineral magnetism to try and

1107
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,040
identify

1108
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,560
where the oil has come from now we've

1109
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,720
done a lot of work

1110
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,839
looking at classic systems for

1111
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,560
sandstones

1112
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,760
and we want to see if we can apply some

1113
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,040
of the things we've learned to

1114
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,480
carbonates

1115
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,000
and then again there's this all water

1116
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
content thing which i touched on it was

1117
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,960
very

1118
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,160
and can we use this these are water

1119
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,320
contacts

1120
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,920
to identify paleo contacts if there's

1121
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,880
been tilting of the reservoir and things

1122
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,760
like that can we

1123
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,480
can we use our knowledge of the magnetic

1124
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,680
signal to do that

1125
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,880
okay thanks very much for that that's

1126
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
the end of the talk thank you for

1127
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,040
listening

1128
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,560
excellent thank you very much adrian

1129
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,320
that was a really really interesting

1130
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,680
talk and we can all thank adrian

1131
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,680
uh via our virtual applause button um

1132
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,280
that was really good um i'm sure we

1133
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,400
probably have a few

1134
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,079
questions um i can actually jump in

1135
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,520
uh now with the question that we got in

1136
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,920
the chat

1137
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,160
while you were talking and this was from

1138
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,560
uh william harbit orbit

1139
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,640
um who asked how could reactive

1140
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,160
geochemical processes including these

1141
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,720
magnetic phases

1142
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,599
impact and change the formation

1143
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,599
permeability

1144
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,040
so i think the so the formation

1145
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
permeability

1146
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,960
yes essentially i think i suspect that

1147
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,079
most of the

1148
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,280
magnetic minerals will not make much

1149
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,839
difference to permeability

1150
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,680
the only one that might do is is the

1151
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,960
cineride because the ciderite tends to

1152
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,359
cement and

1153
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,800
we're trying to get a handle on how much

1154
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,119
soda right there is there so most of the

1155
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,119
magnetic minerals that we see

1156
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,599
um the concentrations are very low

1157
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,480
they're down in parts 100 000 parts per

1158
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
million

1159
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,200
whereas the ciderite is a slightly

1160
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,040
higher concentration we think maybe it

1161
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,040
may be one or two percent so

1162
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,800
that could you're right that could

1163
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,760
reduce the permeability of the rocks we

1164
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,359
haven't actually something we haven't

1165
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,960
really looked into but

1166
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:48,000
yeah that's potentially an effect that

1167
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,320
you should consider with the

1168
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,440
and how prevalent are the thromboids um

1169
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,480
with respect to

1170
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,560
the smaller particles

1171
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,599
um they are

1172
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,520
it's one of those things you look at an

1173
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,040
electron microscope and you get drawn to

1174
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,800
the big fancy fanboys because they look

1175
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,119
nice and a nice picture

1176
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,480
but i think and it's hard to do proper

1177
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,839
quantities for analysis on

1178
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,400
on the electron microscope because the

1179
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,359
concentration of the magnetic particles

1180
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
is so low and we've done a magnetic

1181
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,079
extract as well

1182
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
so it's really hard to quantify them but

1183
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,359
i would say they're not particularly

1184
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,760
abundant i would say we do

1185
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,720
see there's more individual particles

1186
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,280
just kind of

1187
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,200
dotted around and the framboids though

1188
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,680
they are pretty a nice look at

1189
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:37,040
um there's probably less of them um

1190
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,400
yeah so they're probably not that common

1191
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,599
yeah and one thing we did with the

1192
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,880
modeling was to show that you really

1193
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,320
need a lot because they

1194
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,079
essentially give a multi-domain like

1195
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,640
signal they you really need a lot of

1196
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,920
framboids to actually

1197
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,359
dominate a magnetic signal of a sample

1198
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,760
you know you don't need that many single

1199
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,280
domain particles or single vortex

1200
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,839
particles individual particles to

1201
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,400
dominate

1202
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:03,920
the the the response in a fork diagram

1203
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,400
cool so we have time for a few more

1204
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,400
questions

1205
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,480
well i'll write one one more um

1206
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,960
on the uh the part where you did have to

1207
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,720
go over

1208
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,320
a little bit quickly we see this spike

1209
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,200
in the magnetization at the

1210
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,680
the interfaces um this is the oil water

1211
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,920
interface i assume

1212
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,160
yeah that's the oil yeah watercolor what

1213
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,560
um what do you think is causing that

1214
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:43,839
uh spike well if i just share my screen

1215
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:43,839
again actually we've got a model uh

1216
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:54,000
let me just so

1217
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,400
um when we did fork analysis across

1218
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,079
that i mean we have a very few samples

1219
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,200
and we did pca analysis and if they've

1220
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,160
had stocks listing you'll probably tell

1221
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,720
me off for

1222
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,280
doing pc analysis with so a few points

1223
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,599
but

1224
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
um you can you don't really need to do

1225
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,960
pizza you can see quite clearly the fork

1226
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,400
diagrams actually at the

1227
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,839
contact themselves are very very

1228
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,520
different to the sort of background

1229
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,400
signal so i know it's not the best fork

1230
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,680
diagram but

1231
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,000
because the samples are very weak but um

1232
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,079
you can see there's a quite distinct

1233
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
population of slightly larger grains

1234
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,040
than

1235
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,839
what you see in the sort of general

1236
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,640
background

1237
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,079
signal and we came up with some models

1238
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,359
and one of the models we came up is that

1239
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,280
the particles

1240
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,880
are formed at the top and then they kind

1241
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,319
of drop down and they

1242
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,640
drop down and kind of get stuck on the

1243
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,560
on the oil water contact layer and it's

1244
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,960
not really a sharp contact it's more of

1245
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,000
a

1246
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,200
zone um another idea that's not actually

1247
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,960
in here is i i kind of

1248
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,560
i'm quite in favor of the idea that

1249
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,839
there's um

1250
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,200
at this particular zone you've got lots

1251
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,960
of hydrocarbons and you've also got

1252
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,880
suddenly mixing with all this water so

1253
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,240
you've got a different chemist

1254
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,680
from different kind of chemistry and

1255
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,520
we're quite keen to do some

1256
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,040
thermodynamic modelling of the exact

1257
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,400
conditions that you get at this

1258
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,079
context i think it's something that's

1259
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,839
just being formed

1260
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,119
due to you know these optimum conditions

1261
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,560
at the particular

1262
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,400
at this context or something being

1263
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,839
formed in situ rather than

1264
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,240
in this model here where we've got these

1265
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,839
little particles essentially falling out

1266
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,839
onto the contact itself

1267
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,079
excellent so we have uh

1268
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,599
time for another quick question from

1269
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,119
anyone okay well

1270
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,720
i've got a quick question uh if i may

1271
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,480
yeah richard so um yeah adrian at the

1272
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,359
start there was all sorts of nice things

1273
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,960
about

1274
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:49,920
how this was going to help in the

1275
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,920
utilization of you know

1276
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,400
mature oil fields um

1277
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,200
so do you think you really have

1278
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,440
something to say on that

1279
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,359
uh i think so i think um

1280
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,640
the stuff on the wall water contacts is

1281
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,960
quite new

1282
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,960
i think that might help i think this

1283
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,680
vertical electric migration is something

1284
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,400
that hasn't

1285
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,760
really been uh has never been done

1286
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
before

1287
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,599
and if we can use the techniques to do

1288
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,560
that

1289
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,200
to identify to help the basic modeling

1290
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,960
then

1291
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,800
um there is a potential to link up

1292
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:34,400
with various companies and we have

1293
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,400
given these presentations to

1294
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,160
a number of oil companies and they have

1295
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,359
shown interest

1296
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,079
to a certain degree but it hasn't

1297
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,440
been taken up fully but there is an

1298
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,720
interest in the sort of work that we're

1299
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,839
doing

1300
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,359
um so yeah i mean especially in places

1301
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,800
like the north sea i think there's a

1302
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,319
scope for this yeah because it's a very

1303
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,560
mature

1304
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:00,800
um system but yeah we haven't made the

1305
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,160
jump yet between what we've been doing

1306
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,680
and actually implementing it in

1307
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,359
in a commercial sense and

1308
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,119
a lot of the stuff that we've just done

1309
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,319
with the i think the most exciting thing

1310
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,520
is the difference between the vertical

1311
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,680
lateral migration

1312
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,040
um this work has only really come out

1313
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,760
and you know it's not even

1314
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,319
published yet it's still accepted or

1315
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,520
impressed

1316
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,040
so yeah

1317
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,880
sounds like an industrial case student

1318
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,240
to me

1319
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,160
yeah uh well we have we are i mean as i

1320
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,119
said um al fraser is one of the guys i

1321
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,720
work with

1322
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,119
he has been working industry for 30

1323
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,319
years so he has a lot of contact so he's

1324
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:44,160
quite he's very well connected and knows

1325
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,400
um who to talk to about trying to uh

1326
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,520
use what we've learned and actually

1327
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,319
apply it rather than

1328
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,520
just to you know publish papers well

1329
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,400
publishing papers is not bad either but

1330
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,200
some of this stuff can actually uh can

1331
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,319
eventually

1332
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,520
can benefit uh recovery and things

1333
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:06,160
it would be good to get our oil from

1334
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,520
um as you said areas which are already

1335
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,160
being explored and

1336
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,280
not have to go and dig up new places

1337
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,920
yeah

1338
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,319
as we have one one other last question

1339
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,560
that's

1340
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:18,079
in the chat from sue and she was just

1341
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,040
asking is there enough magnetite

1342
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,000
for a magnetic signature at the surface

1343
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,640
and

1344
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,599
um is there how does that compare to

1345
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,560
this or 4d

1346
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,560
gravity surveys

1347
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,319
is there enough to get at the surface

1348
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,920
signature we would love that to be a

1349
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,000
magnetic anomaly but we're talking about

1350
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,839
samples that we are struggling to

1351
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,040
measure in a squid magnetometer

1352
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:48,319
so the answer is not

1353
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,760
really significant levels

1354
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,119
you know some of the nuances that we're

1355
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,040
seeing not getting these very high

1356
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,000
levels that would lead to clear magnetic

1357
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,599
anomalies at the surface um there might

1358
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,880
be scenarios where you

1359
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,599
do have that but in the systems we've

1360
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,400
been looking at

1361
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,720
the concentrations have been quite low

1362
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,720
um

1363
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,640
how does this compare with 40 gravity i

1364
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,640
could also these seismic surveys um

1365
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,720
i don't really have an answer to the

1366
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,760
gravity surveys

1367
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,520
um as i said the magnetization

1368
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
the concentrations looking at so small

1369
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,079
so even though we've got magnetic

1370
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,440
particles there that the concentration

1371
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,240
is so small it doesn't probably really

1372
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,319
add

1373
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,000
significantly to any density that you're

1374
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,200
going to pick up in a gravity survey i

1375
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,440
wouldn't have thought

1376
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
um we've been trying to we've you know

1377
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,760
we've not been thinking the gravity of

1378
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,040
seismic surface we've been thinking of

1379
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,200
can we actually

1380
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,720
um relate this to you know an

1381
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,680
aeromagnetic survey would be the obvious

1382
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,520
thing

1383
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,040
but then we were thinking more if this

1384
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,800
was going to be used

1385
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,560
it would be used more at the level of

1386
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,960
people collecting um

1387
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,560
cores and analyzing cause that's the

1388
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,240
soft level we're looking at just because

1389
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,599
the concentrations

1390
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,800
are quite low i

1391
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,760
i'm not sure is my mic working

1392
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,720
can you hear me oh okay sorry no i was

1393
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,040
talking about the

1394
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,800
the 40 gravity surveys where people are

1395
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,680
tracking the migration of the

1396
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,319
oil interface and i'm just wondering if

1397
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,880
that

1398
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,079
um has been i guess it hasn't been

1399
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,240
looked at with the mag because the

1400
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,160
concentration is too low but i'm

1401
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,640
thinking of the squid magnetometers that

1402
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,960
were

1403
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,599
you know we're using in south africa on

1404
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,920
airborne flights

1405
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,920
um

1406
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,680
it's just very speculative so in

1407
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,200
imperial we do a lot with big group

1408
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,720
working with 40 sizes so i guess it's

1409
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,800
very similar to the

1410
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,319
4d gravity service and they do see the

1411
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,880
migration no we haven't

1412
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,319
we haven't tried to link that together

1413
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,079
and that's something we probably

1414
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,720
could do uh working with people and yeah

1415
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,280
who do do

1416
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,480
the well do 40 seismic but it's a

1417
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,400
similar sort of idea

1418
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,400
trying to track migration we haven't

1419
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,200
tried to link that together we've been

1420
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,720
doing

1421
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,280
this 3d data and then using um a suite

1422
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,480
of schlamberger

1423
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,480
programs to predict the migration path

1424
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,119
that's have been our policy but yeah i

1425
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,200
think maybe

1426
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,480
trying to tie this in with some 4d data

1427
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,079
would probably be

1428
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,160
a good idea and something we haven't

1429
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,520
explored yet but maybe we should

1430
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:33,040
do i still sounds very interesting yeah

1431
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,880
yeah i mean i i i yeah i mean i really

1432
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,079
would like it to be able to you know use

1433
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,920
a squid and

1434
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,520
switch magnetometer and fly it behind uh

1435
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,040
a plane and pick up the magnetic

1436
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,880
anomalies due to this and

1437
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,160
maybe on very large scale features you

1438
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,480
can see that but there's sort of

1439
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,000
the kind of smaller features that we've

1440
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,359
been looking at you know there's great

1441
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,880
depths looking at features

1442
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,440
which you know these inject types which

1443
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,800
are you know quite small

1444
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,000
um we're not i the magnetization really

1445
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,480
is quite low

1446
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,880
i think it's going to be difficult to

1447
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,599
apply this routinely to

1448
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,200
um in in some sort of aeromagnetic

1449
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,800
survey or even a

1450
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,559
a drone survey which is you know

1451
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,240
obviously much closer i think

1452
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,319
it obviously depends as well on the

1453
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,440
depth of the hydrocarbons of course

1454
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,240
a lot of the stuff that we've been

1455
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,599
looking at in the north sea is um

1456
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,280
you know it's under several kilometers

1457
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,240
of water under several kilometers of

1458
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,720
rock

1459
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,000
so you know we're quite a long way from

1460
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,319
the source

1461
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,680
if we're you know doing a survey of some

1462
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,040
sort of

1463
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,200
of some sort of survey excellent

1464
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,480
um well thank you very much adrian um

1465
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,040
we'll wrap it up

1466
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,760
for today so i wanted to uh thank adrian

1467
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,760
once again

1468
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:49,359
um for a really interesting talk and

1469
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:53,680
just before we all go just a quick

1470
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:56,640
um a quick reminder

1471
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,359
that the seminars um are available

1472
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,920
online

1473
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:02,880
um through the youtube channel the magic

1474
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,880
youtube channel so thank you again to

1475
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,160

1476
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,559
that for us

1477
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,520
um and in the coming weeks and months we

1478
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,839
have uh

1479
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,599
several several more speakers lined up

1480
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,839
so i'm looking forward to

1481
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,119

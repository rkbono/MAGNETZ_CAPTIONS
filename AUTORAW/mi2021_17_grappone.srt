1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
the talk i would like to give today is

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,279
on

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,760
the topic of my phd which is

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,000
a new 3-axis automated stepwise

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,599
thermo-magnetometer system

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,599
which i have named smarter

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:23,279
so a bit about me um i started off

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,439
as a mechanical engineer and then

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,439
i got turned into a paleomagnetist twice

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,480
once when i was in undergrad because i

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,440
worked with uh professor joe kershwink

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,800
to create a in-situ field magnetometer

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,399
system

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,719
which we then used to study um

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,920
figurines in guatemala which

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,680
apparently you can tell the

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,879
apparent sex of the figurine heads

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,520
by looking at where they have a

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,039
lightning strike

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,320
simultaneously to this in 2015 i started

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,799
a master's

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,320
degree also at caltech where my

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,640
specialization was in paleomagnetism

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
then when i was applying for phds i

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,119
decided to combine

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
the two and became a paleomagnetic

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,600
engineer

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,360
in effect my thesis is

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,680
prototyping the next generation

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,040
versatile paleomagnetic laboratory

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,479
i finished that in september of

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,119
2020 and one of the main results from

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,439
that

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,720
is the new automated magnetometer system

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,720
that i'll be talking about today

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,119
so in a normal paleomagnetic laboratory

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,759
you have a few options for what type of

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,880
equipment you want to use

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,520
and you have a very cheap

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,960
very robust but also very work intensive

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,000
option

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,520
of the jr6 spinner magnetometer this is

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,920
a extremely good piece of equipment

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,200
um if for example a lab is shut down for

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
seven months due to

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,599
unforeseen circumstances and then you

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
want to reopen the lab

48
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,560
the first thing that will work is the

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
spinner magnetometer

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,160
to go with that you also need a way

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,680
to get either

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,560
um a thermal demagnetization

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,400
or an afd magnetization and so you then

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
need a separate piece of equipment

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
to actually demagnetize it to then

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
measure everything on the spinner

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,760
magnetometer

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,360
for scale on these two pictures

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,640
the squares that are made by the

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,239
cages are 2 feet

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:55,200
on each side or 60 centimeters

62
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:59,120
there's another option it is faster

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,120
and sensitive but much more expensive

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
and this is the rapid system

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
this is a picture of the one we

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,920
currently have here

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,040
for scaling purposes it's the same

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,200
60 centimeter squares

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,959
and the sample changer lets you use up

70
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,480
to 99 specimens at a time

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,280
that will then be automatically measured

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
um which is extremely helpful it means

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
that

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,000
for example you can give a presentation

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
at magnetic interactions

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
while something is running on the other

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,239
side of the lab

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,680
and okay so that's great

79
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,280
still very large and

80
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,400
there's um another option to go with

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,080
that

82
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,760
where if you want to avoid having to

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,200
pay much attention to it you can run

84
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,120
each sample individually in situ

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,920
and in the case of the rapid this is

86
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,799
done with an afd magnetization coil

87
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,519
which is built in this is extremely

88
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,720
helpful

89
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,480
because it means that you can get an

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,840
entire paleo direction

91
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,439
by clicking go and never having to come

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,120
back

93
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,880
and the other option is used

94
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,040
pretty much exclusively by the

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,560
university of liverpool laboratory

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,199
and it's the tristan microwave system

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,600
this is a stock photo because the system

98
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,800
is currently down for maintenance

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,120
but the idea with this one is

100
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
you can get one paleo intensity estimate

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
at a time

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,600
so you can fine-tune the data

103
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,639
and the experimental procedures after

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,440
you get each data point

105
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,040
so then the question is we have these

106
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,919
two ways of doing it we have a good

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,560
system

108
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,680
to get alternating field

109
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,440
demagnetizations quickly

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
we have a good way to do paleo

111
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,479
intensities

112
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,479
um with the very specialized microwave

113
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,880
equipment

114
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,840
but then the question that comes after

115
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,039
that

116
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,160
is can we take the best parts of each of

117
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,840
these

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,479
and turn them into something new

119
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,720
so in order to do this we need to then

120
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,720
get

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,240
a temperature range that will cover most

122
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
magnetic minerals so at least 600

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,520
degrees in order

124
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,039
to get uh magnetite

125
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,840
or um 700 degrees if you want to also

126
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,120
get hematite

127
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,560
then there are um

128
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
another requirement that we need our

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,000
three axis full vector

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,880
uh measurements both paleo direction and

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,039
paleo intensity data would be best

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,680
a goal is for it to be solid state so

133
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,039
there's no movement while measuring

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,759
um one goal would also be no movement

135
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,319
while heating or measuring to do the

136
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,680
same in the same place

137
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
this one does not do that we wanted

138
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,639
specifically

139
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,280
to see if we could do this using high

140
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,120
sensitivity squid sensors

141
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,880
and most importantly we wanted a more

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,479
moderate cost

143
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,520
uh there's no way we're going to be able

144
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,199
to get this as cheap as a

145
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,919
jr6 spinner but we're trying to get

146
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,039
something

147
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,199
that isn't quite as expensive as a rapid

148
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,360
system

149
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:41,520
so this is the very prototype design

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,800
it has um an automated control system

151
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,560
it can give you a thermal

152
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
demagnetization and give you a paleo

153
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,400
direction

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,520
in about 30 minutes using 30 degree

155
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,039
temperature steps it will give you full

156
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,479
vector 3-axis magnetic data

157
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,759
and you will notice that all the parts

158
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,599
used are non-magnetic such as the

159
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,360
aluminum rf shielding

160
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,360
or the wooden quad pod

161
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,599
and the metal shield of course is

162
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,840
extremely magnetic on

163
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,080
the flip side as our primary source of

164
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,720
shielding

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,160
the control system for it is relatively

166
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
straightforward

167
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
the temperatures are input or calculated

168
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
as

169
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,120
the case may be it gives an output file

170
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,599
that outputs squid voltages

171
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
and it can be run in different modes

172
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,919
depending

173
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,000
on how many squids are installed

174
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
in mine i have two installed but you can

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
have up to three

176
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,199
as a function of the actual squid

177
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,319
controller box

178
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,160
and so the squid sensors are the

179
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,199
part that makes this more difficult

180
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,160
and that's the internal part and so the

181
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,440
superconducting

182
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
quantum interference device sensors have

183
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,360
to be

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,400
extremely cold in order to operate

185
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,960
we use a high sensitivity um

186
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,440
squid sense high temperature squid

187
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,639
sensors that have a lower sensitivity

188
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,400
than the ones you find on the rapid but

189
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,479
the flip side to that is they only

190
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,720
require liquid nitrogen temperatures

191
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:26,639
instead of liquid helium and

192
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,840
for this design that we have here

193
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,800
we can use between 8 and 20 millimeter

194
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,839
outer diameter specimens

195
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,279
10 millimeter is the preferred but

196
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,240
for some applications 20 millimeters

197
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,039
will work

198
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,919
but the main limiting factor since a lot

199
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,040
of paleo

200
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,720
intensity studies are done on basalts is

201
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,519
that anything

202
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,360
substantially larger than 10 millimeters

203
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:59,040
tends to saturate the squids

204
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:04,080
the one drawback to these squids is that

205
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:07,120
they operate in the radio frequency

206
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,600
the radio spectrum and that means

207
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,680
that they're very sensitive to any

208
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,720
external interference

209
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,080
such as someone having a cell phone

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,279
someone being on a computer people doing

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
building work

212
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,680
police sirens going by and

213
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,640
that's where all the thin aluminum

214
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,600
shielding that you can see on the

215
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,240
internal and external diagrams

216
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
comes into play

217
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,399
so one of the great things is that we

218
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
now

219
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,320
have preliminary demagnetization data

220
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,760
all these data

221
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,080
came um during the

222
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,800
pandemic basically because it started

223
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
operating

224
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,560
in february and on the left

225
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,680
we have two example orthogonal plots

226
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,279
from two of the samples that we've been

227
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,399
running

228
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,560
these are from hawaii so they are

229
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,240
young and real samples but we gave them

230
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,200
laboratory

231
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,440
um trms in the down z direction

232
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,720
or in the up z direction depending on

233
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,320
the exact experiment

234
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,000
and as the orthogonal plots

235
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:30,720
generally have a trend of being

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,920
downward but it's not perfect

237
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,279
on the right side uh plotting these on

238
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,160
equal area plots the equivalent data

239
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,440
from the rapid

240
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,440
are extremely good almost exactly

241
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,560
what it should be within the margin of

242
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,560
error

243
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,360
of just the re-magnetization process

244
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,600
with smarter the data are a lot more

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,880
scattered

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,839
but the correct answer of

247
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,000
an inclination of 90 falls within the

248
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,440
alpha 95

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,600
so is it a replacement for the rapid no

250
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,480
can you get quick estimates from it that

251
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,880
seem

252
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,160
generally reasonable on average yes

253
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,519
so then the next step is can we get

254
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,560
preliminary paleo intensity data

255
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,640
and the answer is

256
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:31,120
maybe so the protocol used

257
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,440
is a stepwise demagnetization in smarter

258
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,160
followed by an external re-magnetization

259
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,079
in

260
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,680
one of the um magnetic

261
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,720
measurements thermal demagnetizing

262
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,000
systems that i showed previously and

263
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
then a second

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,880
stepwise demagnetization

265
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,360
these diagrams that i show here are

266
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
meant to look similar to arrive lots but

267
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,279
they are not

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the same um

269
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,000
plotted here are the

270
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,000
relative magnetization

271
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,360
of the first attempt at where it was

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,200
supposed to be a

273
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,040
40 micro tesla lab field then a 60 micro

274
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,279
tesla lab field

275
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,200
and from the slopes we can see that

276
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,560
there are estimates

277
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,120
that are in the high 50s which is pretty

278
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
good

279
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,800
considering we were trying to pull out

280
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,839
60

281
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,800
but the r squared values are

282
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,800
relatively poor

283
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,880
and because of that i doubt these data

284
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,079
would really pass any type of selection

285
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,959
criteria

286
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,320
nor would they would most um arrive plot

287
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,839
selection criteria

288
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,160
really be able to apply correctly to

289
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,720
these

290
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,320
so this is still the work in progress

291
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,480
that i've been working on

292
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,480
um since everything started reopening

293
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,000
so the question then comes how did how

294
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
did we do

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,120
compared to what we were wanting

296
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
we get the 600 degree temperature range

297
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,360
thereabouts

298
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,040
we don't get the 700. we have automated

299
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,639
measurements

300
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,880
we have believable paleo direction data

301
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,440
on

302
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,000
average maybe we can get paleo intensity

303
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,600
data

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,200
from this to be determined we do have

305
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
solid state there's no measurement while

306
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,560
moving

307
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,560
there's a measurement before and after

308
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,279
there's movement before and after

309
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,199
measurement but it doesn't require

310
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,040
spinning or vibrating the sample while

311
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,000
measuring

312
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,199
we do have our squid sensors and the

313
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
cost is relatively

314
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,279
moderate um unless you include

315
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,279
the cost of my international tuition

316
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,399
here in the uk in which case it probably

317
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,800
costs more than a rapid

318
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,320
and so in summary smarter lives

319
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,519
you can get the 30 minute

320
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,199
demagnetization that we wanted

321
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,199
paleo intensity is still in the works

322
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,639
it is ideal for pilot studies but more

323
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,240
precision

324
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,040
is definitely desired and as you can see

325
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,199
the design

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,600
is very prototyped considering

327
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,680
the quad pod is something we just had

328
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,079
lying around

329
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,519
and so the design will need finalizing

330
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,639
before this really can be

331
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,320
taken forward thank you for listening

332
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,639
um i'll take any questions that you

333
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,639
might have

334
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,839
thank you for the talk so do we have

335
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,519
anything any questions

336
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,959
yeah if i i've got a question where i

337
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,600
can jump in so

338
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,680
um i have two questions actually so you

339
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,040
talked about directional data

340
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,199
maybe you said this and maybe i missed

341
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,120
it but if you're doing directional data

342
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,480
what size of the samples because you

343
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,040
know the smaller the samples

344
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,680
the harder is you know there's more

345
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,680
handling

346
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,120
errors in you know putting the sample in

347
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,480
and stuff in terms of getting directions

348
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
so

349
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,079
uh so the ones that i used are 10

350
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,680
millimeter

351
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:18,320
specimens so that they are

352
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,800
sufficient that you can actually orient

353
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
them

354
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,399
unlike the tiny five millimeter

355
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,440
microwave course

356
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,560
that are basically unorientable

357
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,639
um but these are big enough that

358
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
you can actually put for example a

359
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,079
circle on them and orient them

360
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,440
but with some of the more sensitive

361
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,000
applications

362
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,560
you would need to use the bigger sizes

363
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
that are

364
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,040
possible with this okay

365
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,279
okay i have another question so so you

366
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,199
so so this system doesn't you can't

367
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,079
apply a field so you can't apply

368
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,880
a trm so like i think the triax system

369
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
which is out

370
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,040
being advertised outside and the put i

371
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,320
mean that can apply a field so is

372
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,800
are there any plans to to put that

373
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
option

374
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,160
into the instrument so you don't have to

375
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
take the samples and

376
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,079
you know induce a trm or something else

377
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,040
where

378
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,160
so there is currently um a way in fact

379
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,600
to apply a field

380
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,639
in it um the current data do not take

381
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,480
advantage of this

382
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,040
because um i tested it

383
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
back in march before everything shut

384
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,519
down

385
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,959
and the oven design that's used

386
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,240
um takes advantage of the actual

387
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,680
helical design of the oven

388
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,240
and part of the advantage of being in

389
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,079
lab is i can show you things

390
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,160
so this is an old oven that as you can

391
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,920
tell is not coiled very well

392
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,800
but inside the oven is a counter coiled

393
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,720
wire the oven itself is non-magnetic

394
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,199
because it cancels itself out

395
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,320
but we determined we can actually run a

396
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
field along

397
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,160
this helix which itself is not

398
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,360
counter-coiled

399
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,640
and we can get a applied field

400
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,919
um in the oven space precisely but

401
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,679
not near the squids

402
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,360
okay so so in the future it might be

403
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,160
possible to do

404
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,600
all the all the the intense experiments

405
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:26,559
entirely inside the instrument

406
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,559
is that yes that's the so okay good

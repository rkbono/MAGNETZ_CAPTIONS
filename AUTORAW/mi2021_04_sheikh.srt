1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,759
uh thank you for

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,560
coming to the talk so i'm just going to

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,679
talk about

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,960
bio magnetic monitoring and

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,000
why do we need a different different

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,039
proxy

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,720
to monitor air pollution so this this um

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,080
this graphic over here basically

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
explains that right

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,320
you know the traditional methods used to

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,439
monitor air pollution

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,800
um uses very spherical

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,880
unified diam you know

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,920
part particles where they take into

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,040
account particulate matter

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
in terms of their diameters which is

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,200
basically

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,320
either pm10 which is

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,920
all the particulate matter which is

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
less than 10 microns then we have pm 2.5

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,160
measurements which you

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,440
might have seen which are every every

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,320
other particle which is

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,440
less than pm uh which is less than 2.5

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,440
micrometers

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
and then comes the more ultra fine

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,840
particles

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,640
which um my research would basically

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,479
focus on

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,240
is is which goes neglected when we are

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
monitoring air pollution using

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,680
traditional methods we would only hear

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,680
about

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,600
particulate matter in terms of 2.5 or 10

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,200
measurements um so what why do we need

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,479
uh what's the big picture

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,200
that right now there the concentration

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,240
of anthropogenic particulate matter

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
is increasing and it's an increasing

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
risk

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,680
to public health and with with

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,000
increasing urbanization and

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,840
um people you know the cities developing

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,320
even though there have been stricter

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,799
stringent policies to

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,479
curb air pollution they're still there

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,240
still more exposure to

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,719
air pollution than it was before and

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,399
this would increase year on year

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,640
so the traditional air pollution

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,159
monitoring monitoring systems do not

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,560
give a full picture

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
of the pollutants present they do tell

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,239
us about

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,879
the amount of particulate matter um in

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,239
terms of

57
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
um in terms of their mass uh per unit

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
volume

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,640
uh but that is something which could go

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,400
more higher resolution and that is where

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,670
we come in um using magnetic and uh

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
you know microscopy techniques we can

63
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,080
[Music]

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,400
you know find pick up these ultra fine

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,720
magnetic particles which go unnoticed

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,160
and biomagnetic monitoring is one of

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,519
those things where

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,200
we can use trees and leaves to find us

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,720
find tell more about the source of

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
particulate matter

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
and the aim is to basically mitigate air

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
pollution

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,040
um you know using specific tree species

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,560
where some tree species are better at

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,239
accumulating particulate matter than

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,080
other species

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,319
and obviously the height comes as a

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,519
factor because after a certain height

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,879
there could be a vortex

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,760
created where instead of mitigating air

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,360
pollution

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,840
the trees actually inhibit

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
more inhibit air circulation which can

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,239
increase

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,959
local concentrations at a particular

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,120
road or

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,319
a building so why biomagnetic monitoring

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
because it can

89
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,760
be used as an estimator of ambient pm

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,480
concentration

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,879
it is a good interface for both dry or

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,280
red

93
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,040
deposition but deposition is in terms of

94
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
rain

95
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,720
could be snow could be anything it could

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,000
be

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,599
suitable for spatial studies and

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,599
can also you know provide a way to

99
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,360
you know exhibit magnetic different

100
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
magnetic parameters across different

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
cities

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,640
where some cities might have more

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,680
vehicular related pollution while some

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,280
might have more industrial related

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,760
um the aims are to

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,360
find a find out about the nature of

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,239
magnetic carriers

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,799
in air pollution at the nanoscale also

109
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
develop

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,280
and interpret more like the magnetic

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,320
proxies of this air pollution

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,199
uh go to cities uh where air pollution

113
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,600
is a

114
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,880
bigger problem and where we can quantify

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,240
it and then

116
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
kind of use it in uh you know cities in

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,960
the europe

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,479
so lahore is one of the cities we might

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,840
be focusing on

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,280
um and then basically

121
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,040
the the final kind of aim is to actually

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,320
mitigate air pollution

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,960
using the data we might have

124
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,880
we might get from from these monitoring

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,400
techniques

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,919
so this is um basically not my data this

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,639
is from a paper

128
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,080
it just gives an idea of what is

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
actually present

130
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,759
and what particles might give us a

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
magnetic

132
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
signal and how how different are the

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,320
morphologies under

134
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,440
different microscopy uh tools so

135
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,560
these pictures are taken um from

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,639
uh from a paper from delgado at all

137
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,320
and this study was done in italy and it

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,400
basically

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,680
shows different kind of particles

140
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,680
present

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,960
a good one which is also magnetic is

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
ferrite over here

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
it's an iron oxide and it's usually

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,160
associated with

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
vehicle parts abrasion and stuff like

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,720
that

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,639
some more different particles

148
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
over here you can see how some

149
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
industrial related

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
particles are have a very distinct

151
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,479
uhedrill

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,880
grain over here some of them might also

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,160
be

154
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
magnetic that is what we're here to find

155
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,880
out

156
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
so this is some some air filter samples

157
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
i had where

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,120
i just had one day on the sem because

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,160
that is what i could get

160
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,960
and this is a typical sem image of

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,400
what you might have in a in a town or a

162
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,240
city and you can see that

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,440
how these grains have this bright

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,800
sub micron or nano scale particle that

165
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,680
could be magnetic

166
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,120
in in nature you could see some of these

167
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
over here as well

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,680
and um

169
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,919
another slide which is from

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
a different paper it's basically

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
applying tm

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,400
to particulate to look at particulate

173
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,319
matter and this is

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
how you can see the scale over here is

175
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,919
on nanometers

176
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,160
so we can see how important are these

177
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
you know these ultra fine particles

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,759
super which

179
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,600
would have a super paramagnetic you know

180
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,759
signal as well attached to it

181
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,280
and this is what we would focus on these

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,520
are not my pictures

183
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,599
but this is something so there is a case

184
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
study i am going to talk about which is

185
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,280
actually

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
the work i did over the past few months

187
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
and

188
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,160
it is from padua italy and

189
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,319
the location was their

190
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,880
department of chemical sciences so fifth

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,639
floor they had this extractor

192
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
attached to the building where they

193
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
sucked air into the sampling room and

194
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,199
that's where the sampling

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,280
took place i got hold of these from

196
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,440
the department of chemistry at cambridge

197
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,000
and the background motivation is

198
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,440
basically to relate the chemical data

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,280
to magnetic and microscopy analysis

200
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,759
uh key questions we were trying to

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,240
answer were what fraction of particulate

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,160
matter

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,080
is magnetic and how

204
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
are they related to certain pollutant

205
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,599
sources and whether

206
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,800
there are any magnetic minerals on a

207
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,800
nanoscale

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
so different methods we used um

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,759
hysteresis loops

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,879
forks done on on an atm

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,800
and microscopy is to be

212
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
still done so i'm just going to present

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
some magnetic

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,840
measurements we face some challenges so

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,840
because

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,759
there is very little um

217
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,639
you know material present on

218
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,319
on the air filters we it had a very weak

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,160
remnants and there was a

220
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
we noticed there was a background

221
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,280
remnants coming just from the blank

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,960
uh probe so what we there was also

223
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,440
difficulty in optimizing the

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,280
sample mounted on the atm so we came up

225
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,640
with a measurement protocol where we

226
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,560
measured the blank filter

227
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,080
blank mount with the grease on and then

228
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,599
we corrected you know our um

229
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,240
our our actual measurement by

230
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
subtracting those averages of the blank

231
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
samples to ensure

232
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
the sample signal was accurately

233
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
presented so here

234
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,200
you can see that these are the blank

235
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,720
measurements and you can see it's not

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
purely dye magnetic there was some

237
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,959
remnants over there

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
and this is what could have you know

239
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,560
contaminated our data so we subtracted

240
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,839
this from our

241
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,880
measurements over here and we slow

242
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,880
corrected our hysteresis

243
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,760
which is present over presented over

244
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,399
here so these are the winter samples

245
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,240
on the left the summer ones on the right

246
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,560
you can see the winters one

247
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,800
winter ones have a higher total magnetic

248
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,200
moment which is what we would expect

249
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,440
because usually winters are usually

250
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,399
higher more polluted

251
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
so um these are the averages of all the

252
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,000
winter samples like 15 samples

253
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,760
and all the summer samples and

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,560
what we can see is basically is that

255
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
you can see that there's a there's a

256
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,720
super paramagnetic

257
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,360
uh signal over there and that there's a

258
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,399
sd

259
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
it's extending into a single domain a

260
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,640
stable bridge

261
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,880
and you can see there is a course uh

262
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
pseudo single domain to multi-domain

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,640
background signal

264
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,120
in these winter forks uh so the summer

265
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,880
ones

266
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
you could it wasn't it's not well

267
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,839
defined because the measurements are

268
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,399
still going on

269
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,320
um so it's a bit noisier over here but

270
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,440
it still has some super

271
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,680
paramagnetic um signal

272
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
which is present and a more pronounced

273
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,000
psd signal

274
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
in the summer ones so these are just uh

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,959
some

276
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,519
to uh some sample uh an individual

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,880
sample where i just want to mention how

278
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,880
the and the derivative of the dcd curve

279
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,519
shows us that

280
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,880
it goes beyond the coercivity

281
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,000
distribution goes beyond

282
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,680
300 milli tesla so probably highlighting

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
as something else present other than

284
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
magnetite

285
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,079
this is the summer one you can see at

286
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,800
around 300 we can see

287
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,600
the coercivity distribution so presence

288
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,760
of magnetite probably

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,279
so the coercivities for both of the

290
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,760
samples

291
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,959
were very narrow between five to eight

292
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,920
milli tesla

293
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,000
so typically of a soft magnetic fraction

294
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,360
such as magnetite

295
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and this is a day plot basically

296
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,279
uh trying uh basically showing that it's

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,920
lying within the psd to md range and

298
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,800
ultra fine you know super paramagnetic

299
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,760
contributions

300
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,480
at this part you know could be present

301
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,760
in the

302
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,240
winter samples so these

303
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
are the total uh this is a kind of a box

304
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,760
and whisker for

305
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,720
the total magnetization for each of the

306
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,680
samples

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,279
and you can see that even though the

308
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,600
winter ones are a bit higher

309
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,839
the the median isn't very much different

310
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,560
from the summer

311
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,120
sample there was no correlation found

312
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
between the total magnetic moment and

313
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,600
the mass of

314
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,320
pm this is for the winter samples

315
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,000
so we failed to reject the null

316
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,639
hypothesis that

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,560
their the magnetic movement is related

318
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,120
to the mass

319
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
so what are the challenges we might have

320
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,279
um

321
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,200
different bio magnetic proxies have

322
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,160
different signatures

323
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,399
and we might have to calibrate that for

324
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,880
different species we need to

325
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,240
correlate the magnetic signals to pm

326
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,399
concentrations and

327
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
they might not be true from cities to

328
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,360
cities

329
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,040
this is a leaf sampling campaign which

330
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,880
we are planning to do in lahore pakistan

331
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,600
so it's basically picking up some leaf

332
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,760
samples and

333
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,440
at different heights and a different

334
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,360
length of the road and then

335
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,880
kind of taking their sirm measurements

336
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,959
and their sar

337
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,720
measurements to it as one of the proxies

338
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
to tell how magnetically

339
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,800
they're different and also microscopy on

340
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
these samples to tell

341
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
us about the different morphologies of

342
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,079
particles present

343
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,760
i would like to thank my supervisor rich

344
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,760
harrison for

345
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
for helping me with some of the stuff in

346
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,839
this

347
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,839
and thank you for listening

348
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,760
well done that's a nice talk it's quite

349
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,680
an interesting uh

350
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,720
twist on things at the end of our

351
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,600
session so uh thank you very much

352
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,240
um does uh anyone have questions so uh

353
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,320
adrian

354
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
you use your hand up there first i

355
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,040
believe

356
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
uh yeah it's more of a comment so a lot

357
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,079
of the questions

358
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,120
that were being raised and asked i mean

359
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,079
there was a

360
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,760
20 years ago there was a eu funded

361
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,959
program called magna it was

362
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,959
there was about 10 post stocks all over

363
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,639
europe working on this and

364
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,560
many of them did a combined biomagnetic

365
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,920
uh study looking at the pollution all

366
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,399
these different cities and looking at

367
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,399
different

368
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,760
type different types of trees and stuff

369
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,600
so

370
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,800
a lot of the questions you're asking

371
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,160
seem to have

372
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,760
been sort of looked at already so i

373
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
just think there might be a case for

374
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,040
going back and looking at literature

375
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,480
there's a lot of work done 20 years ago

376
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,360
on this sort of thing so

377
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,959
um you know you the way that the way it

378
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
was phrased it felt like a bit like a

379
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,360
lot of these things were new

380
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
but it didn't come across as

381
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,880
particularly new and

382
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,880
i guess my question is i mean if you've

383
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,399
got all these very

384
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,120
low temperature particles

385
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
sorry small ssp particles i mean have

386
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,279
you thought about doing your low

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
temperature measurements because if

388
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,800
you've got particles which are

389
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,839
30 or 20 nanometers you're not going to

390
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
see them

391
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,800
doing room temperature measurements you

392
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,839
need to really have you thought about

393
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,040
doing your low temperature

394
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,199
so that is that is one of the thank you

395
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,000
yeah and uh thank you adrian the

396
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,639
we we i have looked at literature and

397
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
i've seen

398
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,639
most of this stuff is done so what i'm

399
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,600
trying to do is build up upon

400
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,600
what is already present so um the

401
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,880
questions i'm trying to answer

402
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,199
are gonna look more on the on the ultra

403
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,399
fine or the nano scale bit of it so that

404
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,920
is something which

405
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,240
that those studies didn't look at and uh

406
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,160
doing low temperature measurements is

407
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
something which is uh

408
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,440
excuse me i don't think that's true

409
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
actually i mean i i did moss bar at low

410
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,680
temperature

411
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,000
and we looked at particles with less

412
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,680
than 10 nanometers so

413
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,360
to say that is to say that it's not

414
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,800
being done is is just

415
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,279
wrong sorry i mean obviously there's a

416
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,320
lot more work to be done but

417
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,399
i mean there has been work done

418
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,360
sorry i would just say i would want to

419
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,839
build

420
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,839
the work which is already done okay

421
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,279
yeah thanks that question i think i

422
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,800
think it's a fair enough comment that

423
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,480
you wish to be constructive and build

424
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,079
upon the work that's been already done

425
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
that's fair enough i think

426
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,360
uh professor williams would you like to

427
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
pitch in with a question or comment

428
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,880
there

429
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
um yeah it was similar to agent so you

430
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,399
know my memory is

431
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
getting worse by the day but uh i'd

432
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
remember that agent had done some work

433
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
in the past and also barbara mayer

434
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,639
but i mean i think what you've done was

435
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,040
quite interesting son and um

436
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,720
from my very poor memory of previous

437
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,160
work it did concentrate on particular

438
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,800
types of material i think particularly

439
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,240
uh

440
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,160
leaves and trees and i remember some

441
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,079
studies talking about how far

442
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,680
back the trees were the lines of trees

443
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,680
from the roads and which way the wind

444
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,680
was blowing and all that sort of stuff

445
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,000
but from your work it looks like you've

446
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,160
looked at a much wider range of uh

447
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,680
material you talked about mosses and

448
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,079
other material

449
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,959
so but but you haven't yet been able to

450
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,399
look at

451
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,519
any uh trends with any on these

452
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,360
particular material

453
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,720
that accumulate on any different type of

454
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,399
organic matter is that right

455
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,320
that's something you're hoping to do

456
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,360
thank you thank you for the question so

457
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,440
the mention of mosses and legends are

458
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,399
that's kind of a bathroom review on

459
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,399
what's been done

460
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,720
i it's just been two months since i

461
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,000
started this project so i've not had to

462
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,079
have enough time to work um to to

463
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,079
you know uh present what i've actually

464
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
done so what i've actually done

465
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
right now is basically kind of a

466
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,199
background study

467
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,400
on how um how we can use the

468
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,079
the magnetic proxies to kind of quantify

469
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,120
particulate matter so it's it's it's

470
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,760
something which is

471
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,120
still in development and i'm not

472
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,120
disagreeing that

473
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,760
something like this hasn't been done

474
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,079
it's just it's a preliminary work i've

475
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,400
done

476
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,640
for two three months so there isn't any

477
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,160
any personal work i've done on mosses or

478
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,919
religions that's that's something from

479
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,120
the literature

480
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,120
two or three months work that looks

481
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,200
pretty good to me okay

482
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,200
thanks very much

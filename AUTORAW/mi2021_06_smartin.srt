1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,040
is which is from simon martin on

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,600
uh using ams for understanding flow in

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,639
analog

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,200
magma intrusions so

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,080
i have seen simon's name somewhere can

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,480
you see me

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,480
i have started sharing my video but it's

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,720
not coming up

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,880
no we can't see it right now oh i can't

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,880
one second let's just go back to this

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,439
i did that thing we were told not to do

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:45,840
there we go

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:45,840
yeah yeah we can now cool

14
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,199
me there we go you got that

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,159
no it's not changed for me just try

16
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,760
display setting it up

17
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,880
it has now yeah yeah you got it cool

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,119
apologies so um um

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,080
uh simon i've recently finished my phd

20
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,080
from the

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,360
university of liverpool with janine

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
cavanagh and uh

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
andy biggin and uh this is some uh the

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,960
work i did for one of my chapters

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,439
on uh using ams for understanding magma

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,240
floor

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,759
in analog magma intrusions it's some

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
work i did with a guy called procup

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,479
zavada

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,479
at the institute geophysics in prague

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
so how do we study daikin placement in

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,560
nature

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
we use a combination of geophysical

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,840
surveys uh

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
field studies ropey floor structures and

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
map across

37
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,600
other macro scale fabrics and uh micro

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,159
scale fabrics like crystal alignment

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,159
and also then uh magnetic anisotropy

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,840
so in the laboratory we study it through

41
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,680
two different models either a viscous

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
indenter model where we use a granular

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,759
horse material and a viscous fluid

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,679
or we use the hydrofracture type model

45
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,080
where we have an elastic host

46
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,400
and then uh either a newtonian or

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,640
monotonic fluid

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
um so some examples of viscous indenters

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
we have uh

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,319
this one here where we look to look at

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
complex intrusion morphologies we have a

52
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
there's an

53
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,720
igneous green black powder um and

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
we eat golden syrups injected into it

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
and to create like

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
complex dike like structures little sill

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,720
bodies

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,080
and cup structures and shape sill type

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,760
bodies

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
but you can also look at the horse rock

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,800
deformation so here you've got a silica

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,000
powder

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,120
um and it's been injected with golden

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
syrup and using digital image

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,239
correlation you can

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,440
look at the how the how different

67
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,160
particles move

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
during the experiment in terms of

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,760
elastic models

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,360
the most common ones are um using

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
gelatin models so this is a block of

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
gelatin here

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400
uh it's dimmed because it's in a

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,959
darkened room

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
and then within the injected fluid so in

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,239
this case it's water

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,080
um in this case it's water uh you

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,680
put small particles which can be

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,879
illuminated by a laser sheet and then

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
you can use a

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,080
particle image follow symmetry to track

82
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
where different um

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,120
where the particles are moving through

84
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,560
time and you can

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,319
in this occasion we've actually showed

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
that there's a jet forming uh through

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
the center of the dike and then you have

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,959
uh

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,200
floor down floor at the edges of the

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,599
dike

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,120
so uh the aim of this project was to

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,040
understand the process that gave rise to

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
magnetic fabrics within intrusion

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,720
analog intrusions and my experiments are

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,720
different because they look at a

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,799
combination of intrusion morphology

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,920
and the associate magnetic fabrics that

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,760
are formed and

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,959
and then these magnetic fabrics can be

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,879
directly compared

101
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:58,000
compared with the ones we see in nature

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,560
so the materials that i use uh i use a

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
fine grain wheat flour about 420 kilos

104
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
of it

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,560
and for each experiment luckily it is

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,080
uh reusable or the majority of it's

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,319
reusable so it's not

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
as expensive as it sounds um it's a

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
cohesive granular material which deforms

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,079
under sheer intention

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,840
and then for the magma analog to use

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,720
plaster of paris um

113
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,880
with a mix of about 14 k 14 kilos of

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,680
plaster and seven kilos of water

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,280
and then it's a pseudo-plastic fluid

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
with a yield stress and it's seeded with

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,639
magnetite

118
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,880
with the magnetite dust and then uh it's

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,160
also had we also had a retardant

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,600
which which then delay solidification

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
from about half an hour which from the

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
time scale of experiment

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,120
up to several hours so all

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,520
solidification is post and placement

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,720
the magnetite particles that we use uh

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
here's an example from

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,919
uh paperback nov reptile and this is

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,360
um it's the same stuff we use here it's

129
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,680
uh

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,479
like filings from from magmatite from

131
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,840
the production of uh

132
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:09,280
i can't remember exactly what but um

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,560
and you can see the shapes and the sizes

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,639
and so you're we're talking

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,720
pseudo majority suitable singing go to

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,320
multi-domain

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,759
material so

138
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,320
the experiment set up uh we have a 1.2

139
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,520
by 1.2 by 0.5 meter box

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,880
with a piston inserted below and then

141
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,320
the uh the plaster is in a chamber

142
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,639
down down here and

143
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,600
it's injected at a constant rate and

144
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,280
then you've got

145
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,120
gopro cameras monitoring the surface

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
um some of the things we can change you

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,320
can have that include a membrane but

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,919
various depths within the tank and we

149
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,039
can change the mixing ratio of the

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,240
plaster so

151
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,320
lower viscosity fluids are higher

152
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,639
viscosity fluids and

153
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
and we've colored it in different ways

154
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,919
so using the concentric colouring you

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
can look at the internal fabrics and how

156
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,720
they develop

157
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,240
or with the sequential colon

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,600
cochlear we can look at time scales of

159
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,800
emplacements of which parts of the

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
intrusion form at what time

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,960
so uh here's the results from one

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,520
experiment

163
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,960
um from the suite that we did it's got a

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,319
two point one mixing the two to one

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,080
mixing ratio

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
it's got no membrane present and it uses

167
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,840
the concentric coloring

168
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,039
type pattern so at zero seconds

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,199
uh this is this is the box full

170
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
and it's covered with a colored sand

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,720
this is the surface like scattered on a

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,000
bit like a jackson pollock painting

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,759
and this is so that you can track

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
multiple multiple cameras can track the

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,440
same points at the same time

176
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,680
and the ground this is the area we're

177
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,840
going to focus on for the next uh

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
the next images and these ground control

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,240
points are 40 meters

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,840
40 centimeters apart

181
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
so this is that section and at 480

182
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,919
seconds

183
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,080
time lapse this is actually a fracture

184
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,280
system starting to form down here

185
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,080
in this orient in this formation so

186
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,880
just go back so you can see that and

187
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,599
then at 985 seconds you've actually had

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,360
quite a lot

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
of deformation the uplift of this

190
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
central section is uh

191
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,800
several centimeters and you've actually

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,560
got quite steep

193
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,120
ring fractures formed and then

194
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
at 120 seconds they've actually had the

195
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,199
eruption

196
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,639
and the subsequent lava flow form

197
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,000
so once it's run leave it to solidify

198
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,160
for for several hours we usually just do

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,759
it leave it overnight

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,080
and then so it's then excavated

201
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
and cleaned up and this is the sort of

202
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
structures we see

203
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
and so this is that same lava flow at

204
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,639
the top of the surface

205
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,759
the injection point is from below

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,840
um is a radial dyke system it forms an

207
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,360
initial radio dank system which the the

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,160
third radial intrusions out here you've

209
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
got one

210
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
and the other two there uh there's like

211
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,919
a central magma body which is like a big

212
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,199
solid blob with like a cup

213
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,080
uh cooked up a surface and then uh

214
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,160
convert to the

215
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,479
conduit to the surface and it's in rare

216
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,800
occasions we also get rested dikes

217
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,000
so dikes which are formed but don't

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
propagate all the way to the surface

219
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,440
um so looking at this section down here

220
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,279
uh this isn't blown up uh

221
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,959
you can on the surface of this you can

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,000
see some consent uh

223
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,039
some curved ridges and these are

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,040
actually asymmetric in shape and

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,959
in profile and i think i'll get to that

226
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,000
a bit later on

227
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,560
um yeah

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,399
and then so then using slices taken

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,320
perpendicular to the floor direction so

230
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,480
flow in this image here is

231
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
uh right to left and same right to left

232
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,920
here you can actually

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,760
look uh see how the internal fabrics

234
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,480
in terms of the colouring have developed

235
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,200
and you get this localization

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
here it through the core of the

237
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,680
intrusion

238
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
so here we now have the magnetic fabrics

239
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,399
and in the top right hand corner is the

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,519
ams ellipsoid and so

241
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,040
here we have slices a b and c

242
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,800
and what we do is we take five

243
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,760
millimeter diameter uh

244
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,200
cores from each slice as many as we can

245
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
possibly get

246
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,399
um and then from these uh

247
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,440
using a we can then look at the ams

248
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,800
and so this is what

249
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,040
these equal area plots

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,959
show magma flow is the arrow in the flow

251
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,920
direction

252
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,120
um the star is the initial flow

253
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,880
direction

254
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
this is the long axis and these are the

255
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,720
short axis of the ellipsoids and circles

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,839
and what we see is uh this this

257
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,360
red area this is uh the imbrication the

258
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,279
maximum implication for

259
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
floor for the left margin and the green

260
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,760
is is the floor for the right

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
uh right hand margin uh and these so

262
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,279
floor is coming out of the page in these

263
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,920
images

264
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,320
and what we see is samples collected

265
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
from

266
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
the left margin uh imprecated in the

267
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
correct way of

268
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,920
inferring floor and this is the same

269
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,040
across

270
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,519
all all slices through here

271
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,519
as well with a slight a slight dip

272
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,320
uh something to note is that all the

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,480
samples are oblate fabrics

274
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
some of them quite oblate and then so

275
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,440
the diamonds down in this corner here

276
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,680
these are from the central zone and so

277
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,120
these are more triaxial to

278
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,760
prolate sort of fabrics

279
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,200
so if we want to link this to nature

280
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,399
which is something we can do with these

281
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
experiments

282
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,959
what we actually see is so these this is

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,120
uh four examples of dike

284
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,680
dykes with lateral flow from nature

285
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,640
with the long axis and short axes and

286
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
and these

287
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,160
uh what they what they show

288
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
is that they fit within these um

289
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,320
implication zones

290
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,760
and then they also match up nicely with

291
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,800
the implication that we get

292
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,760
from this model which supports the

293
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,800
interpretations from nature and also

294
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,720
backs up the mod

295
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
the analog models that we've performed

296
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
so the employment model that we've got

297
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,519
and so initial

298
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
this is this is what i've sort of

299
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,680
developed and it's

300
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,959
initially placement with the plaster

301
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,519
through the center with the floor

302
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,120
profile

303
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,959
and and then we get a build a stress

304
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,880
builder put the tip and a breakout

305
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
which is then creating these asymmetric

306
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,320
ridges on the sides here this is because

307
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,000
this is a top-down view and this is like

308
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,399
this asymmetric ridge in profile

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
and you get floor concentrated through

310
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,680
the center of the

311
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,959
of the intrusion with uh then of the

312
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,880
oblate fabrics

313
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,720
which we see developed at the edges

314
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,920
which created them by compression and

315
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,279
shear of the

316
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,320
plaster and the magnetite in the plaster

317
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,079
along along those margins and in those

318
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,240
margin regions

319
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,279
uh with flow focus through the court and

320
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,120
then uh

321
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,440
this happens again here

322
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
so flaw is further focused through

323
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
through the core

324
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
and it gradually it's gradually building

325
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,440
an increase in the thickness

326
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,279
up to a maximum thickness of about two

327
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,399
cent to about about three to four

328
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,839
centimeters

329
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,720
uh for the thickness of these intrusions

330
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,240
with uh multiple breakouts creating

331
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,600
multiple ridges and and

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,240
those multiple stages of the floor

333
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,920
so uh magnetic fruit uh some conclusions

334
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,440
of the magnetic fabrics in the intrusion

335
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
course of just lateral flow along the

336
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,639
dike which is

337
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
uh supports what we know and the

338
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,760
orientation of the dike compared with

339
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
um the injection point the oblate

340
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
fabrics in the margin suggest a

341
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,760
compression of the plaster and

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
implication of the flow towards the dike

343
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,720
tip

344
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
imprecrated fabrics in the intrusion

345
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,120
margins correlate with studies of dikes

346
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,160
from the

347
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
from nature and a range of external and

348
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,480
internal structures

349
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,000
observed in the experimental intrusions

350
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:35,839
helped test emplacement models as well

351
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,839
thank you very much

352
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,720
thank you very much simon has anyone

353
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,199
got any questions

354
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
at all

355
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,920
yeah all right okay go ahead

356
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
well nice talk simon thanks so much for

357
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,079
that that was great

358
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,120
so so based off the results that you

359
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,480
have

360
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,040
here the used what sort of

361
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,680
data set or or do you have kind of a

362
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,839
field area in mind that you can

363
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,079
most readily compare or that you'd like

364
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,560
to sample to compare to these results

365
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,839
to try and really unite the analog model

366
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,839
with

367
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
with the field exam

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,720
um in terms of dykes i think this

369
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,839
uh this can be applied to

370
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,760
any any dyke so any

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,079
wherever you've got really good exposure

372
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,440
of dikes with no alteration which is a

373
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,760
which is a key point um then

374
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
uh you can wait so you can get primary

375
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,680
floor and

376
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,639
and things like from the dike then yes

377
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
there's this

378
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,160
whole host of places you can go and i've

379
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,079
also done

380
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,279
experiments or an experiment where i've

381
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,040
also created a lackluster

382
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,920
body and so i've not sampled that for

383
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,320
the ams yet

384
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,360
but for that i'd like to compare that to

385
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,279
somewhere

386
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
potentially like sand fell or like a

387
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,440
sill type body like

388
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,000
uh like mult like the big uh where

389
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,079
you've got

390
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,279
really nice several kilometer exposure

391
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,519
of the same

392
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
sill

393
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,320
yeah it's funny you say that i happen to

394
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,160
know a guy who's got a good ams data set

395
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,830
from sand phil

396
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,440
yeah so do i

397
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,920
[Laughter]

398
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
fair enough

399
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,000
any other questions

400
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
um can i ask a quick question if you can

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,199
hear me

402
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,720
yeah we can uh i said i i didn't get to

403
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,519
meet you there the last time you opened

404
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,920
said andrew simon but um

405
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,800
just like because interesting talk just

406
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,959
you know the way

407
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,160
you your fabrics are comparable to the

408
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,120
field examples

409
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,600
when you do this um this modeling is

410
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
right

411
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
was there ever an example of this

412
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,720
post-emplacement sagging or collapsing

413
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
uh you know like a kind of a downward

414
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
flow being captured within these fabrics

415
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,800
or

416
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,160
um so i did run an ex

417
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,519
a trial experiment with a mixing ratio

418
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,720
of for plaster of one to one so it was

419
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,920
uh it was very very liquid and as we

420
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
were injecting it

421
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,199
um when we stopped the injection there

422
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
was down floor

423
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,360
uh back down into the um back down is

424
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
the conduit

425
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,600
however with these large uh with the

426
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,360
larger intrusions

427
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,360
uh we sorry with a higher mixing ratio

428
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
uh left the gopro cameras running one

429
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,800
time like way beyond like for a couple

430
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,399
of hours afterwards

431
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,199
and from what i remember i don't think

432
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
we saw

433
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,959
much much sagging out so even in the

434
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,000
lava flow at the surface

435
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,199
i don't remember seeing much like that

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,399
and then from

437
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,079
and also from um

438
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
just from leaving it and going in the

439
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
next day

440
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,320
the shape of the material in the conduit

441
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,319
seemed

442
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:11,839
very similar there wasn't a massive back

443
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,839
floor into the conduit

1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,440
uh let's talk first paleomagnetic data

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,799
from the

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,799
bleismeier darlor

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,679
exactly just what i said so when you're

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,759
ready there adrian take it away

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,680
uh thank you conor hopefully you can all

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,880
see my my screen there

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,320
so this is work that was done with uh

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
morton resources and now at the

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,680
ferrari's geological survey and connell

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,960
who's just been speaking

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,679
um there was a number of uh summer

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,599
students

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,760
imperial so stefan mathia and hassan

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,440
who's now doing his phd at uh

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
cambridge who helped all the

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,480
measurements plus uh

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,800
an m i think it's ms or msi

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
student at in oxford called carrie who

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,760
also help with the measurements

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
um so why did we go to

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,239
northern iceland and collect some

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
samples and what was the point so

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,760
let's just go back and have a look at

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
paleomountains and 101

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,359
um one of the things you first learn

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,079
when you do paleomagnetism is the idea

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,080
that the magnetic inclination we measure

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,680
uh tells you about the paleo latitude so

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
tan i equals two time land and we all

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
know that

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
and this is based on the assumption if

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,240
we average the geomagnetic field over a

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
long enough period of time

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
um we end up with something called the

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,680
geocentric axle dipole so we essentially

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,360
have a dipole field

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
which is aligned with the rotation axis

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,600
and hopefully everyone who's in the

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,360
audience should be familiar with this

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
now the question is how long do you have

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,560
to average the field so

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,600
here's uh some some different uh periods

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
of being

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
of averaging so in figure a we have up

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
here we have

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,960
historical data and you can see we don't

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,960
quite have the guard

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,560
is what we expect to be the proper guard

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
field and we don't

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
quite have the guard here if we go from

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,040
zero to seven thousand years

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280
again it doesn't quite match match this

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,280
and if we go over a longer period of

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,720
time so and work by katherine johnson

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
and catholic constable

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,799
they looked at a period of five million

58
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,479
years then again you can see it doesn't

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,439
quite match up with the

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,240
with the gadfield and if we have a look

61
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,000
at this

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,720
in a little bit more detail um

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,879
so this is now looking at the deviation

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
from the gad field as a function

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,160
of latitude this is for directional data

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,080
so

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,840
it's just deviation so that a perfect

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
guide field would be plotting the data

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
should be plotting along this line in

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,000
the middle

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,760
and you can see that it seems to deviate

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,879
as a function of latitude

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,560
um and we have to fit components

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,560
permanent components of

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,160
um of uh quadrupole and optical

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,840
components down here six or

77
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,920
three percent to get the directional

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,000
data to align

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,319
uh to accommodate this data um

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,959
i presented some of this data at a

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,280
meeting in cape town 2017 it was one of

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,480
these sessions that was combined

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,319
modelers

84
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,560
and um and data people

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,519
and i presented the data and data didn't

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
agree with their

87
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
theory and i was told the data was wrong

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,200
which i think was

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
i didn't really agree with the time

90
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
because you know the model should follow

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,159
the data not the other way

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,879
right so that's the directional data but

93
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,040
if we look at the paleo intensity data

94
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,560
that the deviation is even bigger so

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,560
here we have in this

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
figure here we have the again we have

97
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
the bin data it's been folded around so

98
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,519
suddenly the northern hemisphere data

99
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,560
is combined together and we have the

100
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
green points here

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,560
are the uh of the data and to try and

102
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
get anything to sort of

103
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,440
so here we have gray line we have the

104
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,799
dipole models this is what we would

105
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,400
expect we'd expect it to

106
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,319
the intensity to increase from the

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,640
equator up to

108
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,239
um up to the uh northern latitudes

109
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
and if you look at the data which is

110
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,879
which is for the last five million years

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,319
uh collected from the pint uh database

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,879
which andy biggin and the guys in

113
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,080
liverpool

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,200
um very kindly administered for the

115
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
for the entire community um you can see

116
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
that the

117
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
we don't get that trend we kind of get

118
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,040
something that comes kind of

119
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
sort of increases and then a very high

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,879
latitude it seems to go down

121
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,640
um now one of the one of the complaints

122
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,000
up against the period intensity data is

123
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
there isn't that much of it especially

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
at high latitudes there's a lot of data

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
here

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,359
so this great this green band here shows

127
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,359
you

128
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,959
the sort of error on these estimates and

129
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,400
you can see that there's a lot of

130
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,000
very narrow bands here and the reason

131
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
for this is because this is where hawaii

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
is and

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,320
people like to go to hawaii and sample

134
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
the rocks there but

135
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,520
to go to other latitudes you can see

136
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,440
there's quite large errors and

137
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
one of the complaints of them the

138
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,160
modelers have said well you're the

139
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
reasons your data doesn't fit the model

140
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
is because you haven't got enough data

141
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,080
points

142
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,400
and so this is particularly interesting

143
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,720
at high latitudes um

144
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,479
and paleo intensity data is particularly

145
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
sensitive at high latitude so here's a

146
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,759
figure from catherine constable

147
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,440
where she when in this figure if we have

148
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
these different sampling points we have

149
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,440
a look we have an equator a mid-latitude

150
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,280
and a high latitude depending on what

151
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,000
parameter we're looking at declination

152
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,960
inclination or the intensity um

153
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,160
depending on that when we project the

154
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,919
sampling

155
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,800
area of the at the core mental boundary

156
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
of the field that we're actually

157
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,840
sampling project down onto the commental

158
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,960
boundary from what we're measuring on

159
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,440
the surface

160
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
you can see that the intensity data when

161
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
we measure high latitude is really

162
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
sampling a very

163
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,479
high latitude data whereas if you look

164
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,479
at the um

165
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,160
it's affected by this region here so

166
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,199
we're actually if we measure the

167
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
insulation that

168
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,720
in iceland say then we're actually

169
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,440
being affected by this large area here

170
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,840
of the field where it's generated

171
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
and the declination is even even worse

172
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,440
so you really lose

173
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
the intensity data is the most sensitive

174
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,680
to

175
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,840
to high latitudes variations of the

176
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,840
field

177
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,960
so we wanted to locality

178
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,720
with high latitudes uh lots of

179
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,039
continuous lava sequence and something

180
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
that's relatively new modern so if we

181
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,840
we want something where we can

182
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
essentially ignore plate tectonics so

183
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,120
iceland is the perfect locality and it's

184
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,560
a very simple geology you have a sort of

185
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,000
spreading ridge down the middle

186
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
the further you get away from that the

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,840
older the rocks get so this is nice

188
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,400
simple geology um so we decided to go

189
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,680
there and

190
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,199
sample some rocks now you can't mention

191
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
field work in iceland without mentioning

192
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,240
leo christensen who unfortunately died

193
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,600
earlier last year

194
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,280
from from cancer um he just retired

195
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,639
that's really quite tragic well not just

196
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
retired but he'd retired a few years

197
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
before but

198
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,639
he was still quite young as that was

199
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,600
quite tragic um

200
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,600
now leo has done amazing field work in

201
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
iceland he spent the last 40 years going

202
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,800
everywhere and we've been to some of the

203
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,479
localities that he's been to and

204
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,080
they really are quite hard to get to so

205
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,199
he's really a great field geologist but

206
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
leo never really liked paleo intensity

207
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
work

208
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
he didn't really believe in pearly

209
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
intensities i thought he didn't work

210
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
very well so

211
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
all the work samples that he's collected

212
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,720
and done the literally thousands of

213
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,639
sites that he's sampled he's always

214
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,440
focused on directional data whereas we

215
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,400
think

216
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,080
the intensity data is actually more

217
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,240
helpful in this case so

218
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,240
while there's a wealth of data for

219
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
iceland there isn't actually that much

220
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,680
paleo intensity data

221
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,400
so several years ago

222
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,680
with colleagues martin connell and also

223
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,280
audi dussing from

224
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,759
dtu in denmark we started sampling

225
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,199
various locations in iceland so we

226
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
started off here

227
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,319
in east iceland and we published a

228
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,520
couple of papers down here

229
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,759
on the work there we did a phd project

230
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
in

231
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,880
in central iceland here with a student a

232
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,800
come still yet to publish that

233
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,319
data unfortunately we took a long time

234
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,840
to get the organ dates so that's why

235
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,120
he's been a bit of a delay in

236
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,720
getting getting that published um

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
but what we wanted to do as part of this

238
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
study was to try and tie up

239
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,560
the the a to get some continuous

240
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
sequence so we wanted to tie up the

241
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
sequence with the

242
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,280
the sequence over here so we wanted to

243
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,800
collect some samples that were

244
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,560
slightly younger than the ones who have

245
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,919
been sampling as part of a's phd thesis

246
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,360
so here we have is blake's blake's me

247
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,720
red de la and i'm sure conor's going to

248
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
correct me for that

249
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
and this is the valley that uh eight did

250
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
his phd it was even harder to pronounce

251
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,160
the ear fjord

252
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,879
the law is where we did this work and

253
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
connell's done

254
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,319
field work in there and also brendan as

255
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,280
part of uh one of

256
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,879
his uh msi project when he was in oxford

257
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,039
also helped to sample some of these

258
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,800
localities here so these are the ones we

259
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,479
studied before

260
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,839
and we wanted to sort of tie something

261
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,519
in it was quite close but slightly

262
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,159
younger so we're injured in this valley

263
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,560
here

264
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,080
now this valley is very very easy to get

265
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,519
to there's a dirt track road that dries

266
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,760
up you just take a four by four you

267
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,240
drive along it's quite simple to get to

268
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,839
blake's mirador which is this one here

269
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
is pretty much uninhabited there's no

270
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,720
roads there's no nothing

271
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,800
so even though it's not very far to get

272
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
to from here to here it's actually quite

273
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,640
hard work so

274
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
we ended up having to drive quite a long

275
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
way across this kind of surface here

276
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
which took us an awful long time so it's

277
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
not

278
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,920
that it's a long way it's just that it's

279
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,560
kind of hard to get to and remember

280
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,000
driving off roads can be dangerous so

281
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,680
you can see down there that

282
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,680
someone else a little bit less care

283
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,440
careful than we were we're getting there

284
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,640
so i just want to stress that getting to

285
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
this valley is actually quite a lot of

286
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,399
work

287
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
um we spent just over a week there

288
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,959
sampling

289
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,560
uh spent our time crossing uh rivers

290
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,560
which are just above freezing and

291
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
getting this is connor here and this is

292
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,640
me on on the right get eaten alive by

293
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,160
flies so it's a wonderful

294
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,959
sampling place but um there's some great

295
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
sections so

296
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,880
you know those we've found three great

297
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,720
sections so i mean morton had actually

298
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,320
been at the the year before to the same

299
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,080
valley and mapped it all so we we knew

300
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,800
what we're going for when we're actually

301
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,600
sampling this is one of our sections so

302
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
we typically

303
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,640
collecting the lavas we start at the

304
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,360
bottom just work our way up

305
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,240
connor likes to drill and the rest of us

306
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
kind of follow him

307
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,920
up the hill um

308
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,160
so we did standard the paleomagnetic

309
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,720
analysis the the data is very

310
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,079
very nice all the data from iceland

311
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
tends to be very nice you have a little

312
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,360
viscous component and then

313
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
bang straight to the origin whether it

314
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,399
doesn't matter whether it's thermal or

315
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,519
af it tends to be very well behaved

316
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,560
unfortunately for this particular

317
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,360
week we were there we got very little uh

318
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
sun so we had very few sun orientations

319
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,760
and

320
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
for those who are used to working who

321
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,399
know about working with

322
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,560
large sequences of uh you tend to get

323
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,200
quite large magnetic anomalies

324
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
um associated around that and work we've

325
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,519
done in

326
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,519
elsewhere in iceland you can routinely

327
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,839
get values deviations of

328
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,120
20 to 30 degrees so unfortunately this

329
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
particular the directional data that we

330
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
got wasn't

331
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
really good enough to do isn't really

332
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
good enough to do directional

333
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,680
analysis of the guard field but it is

334
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
good enough to do we need to strike a

335
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,959
few so we need to build an age model so

336
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
we've managed to

337
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,640
use combining the studiography in the

338
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
field with the minitos trigger field we

339
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,839
started to build an age model

340
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,920
um again we are waiting so the age model

341
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,800
isn't complete but we we know the

342
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,560
the ages are between something like 3.2

343
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
to 2.5 million years

344
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
i'm not going to finalize this because

345
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,240
we're currently

346
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
uh getting some samples stated in these

347
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,640
called bride

348
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,000
um argan samples are organ dating and

349
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,079
they've been with them two years now

350
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,279
they said it happened by december 2020

351
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,600
and we haven't got them but i can

352
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,160
happily wait another month or two for

353
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,760
for that and so that the age model isn't

354
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
quite complete but hopefully that will

355
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,360
be soon but the main focus of our

356
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,760
uh what was really um the paleo

357
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,920
intensity work so

358
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,440
unlike liverpool it's like doing a multi

359
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
uh protocol

360
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,639
technique and i actually do like that

361
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,839
approach doing lots of protocol the

362
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,560
problems and you've got lots of samples

363
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,800
do

364
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,720
you do how'd you do it so we've we've

365
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,320
just attended to try and process a lot

366
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,600
of samples just to stick to techniques

367
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
that are tried and test

368
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,720
tested and don't give any problems with

369
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
the

370
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
with the reviewers so we've done the

371
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
izzy technique which is a type of tele-a

372
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,800
method

373
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,560
and we made attempts at getting a paleo

374
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
intensity but we only end up with 52

375
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,519
estimates which was a little bit lower

376
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
than what we'd hoped for because in

377
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
previous

378
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,000
work in iceland we had a success rate of

379
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,600
up to about 60

380
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,760
for the for the rocks but but these

381
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,120
particular ones we had a success rate

382
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,720
of less than uh 30 percent anyway i'm

383
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
just showing you typical arrive lots

384
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
some curves i'm not

385
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
um

386
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,600
okay so then to jump to the results

387
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,360
where we had all these samples we ended

388
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,920
up all these

389
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,079
individual sites we ended up with nine

390
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,160
estimates for the uh

391
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,839
paleo intensity from from only nine

392
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,560
sites something we had to chuck away at

393
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,880
the

394
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,680
site level as well as at the individual

395
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,839
level

396
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,839
so if we look at the pint database here

397
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
we can see this is the

398
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,480
for the for the same bin that we're

399
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,279
looking at we can see the mean pi

400
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,200
is here and this is the data that we've

401
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
collected so in the whole it's slightly

402
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,120
lower than what was

403
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,120
there before but not that much lower

404
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,959
okay oops so how does this relate to

405
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,480
the data the figure i showed you so

406
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,839
here's the figure i showed you earlier

407
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,040
with the data we're interested in this

408
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,800
particular

409
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
what we're doing is just sampling this

410
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,160
point here so before there was

411
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,200
i think a total of about only 48 per

412
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,360
intensity

413
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
estimates that's from 48 sites make up

414
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,600
this particular point in the pipe

415
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,000
pipe database after you've put in some

416
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
criteria to select points so you know

417
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,160
minimum number of

418
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,199
uh estimates to make a site reading that

419
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
sort of stuff

420
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,720
so the argument from the modelers was

421
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
that our this data point

422
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,120
should be further up should be closer to

423
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,519
this dipole curve and the reason it

424
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
wasn't

425
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,680
higher is going to have enough data so

426
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,560
the idea would be if we added more data

427
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,519
added more data we should be going

428
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
moving this point

429
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,279
up now of course i've just shown you on

430
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,399
the previous figure that

431
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,440
our data actually lies beneath that so

432
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,000
it's down here so it's

433
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,560
lower than the average so of course when

434
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,720
you add in

435
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,320
uh sorry when you add in the extra point

436
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,079
rather than moving this

437
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
so so this blue point is now the

438
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,600
combined mean of what was in the

439
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,800
pint database plus uh our new

440
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,399
blix mirror you can see that we've

441
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,079
actually moved

442
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,519
the screen point has moved downwards to

443
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,399
where the blue point is so if anything

444
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,199
we've moved

445
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,839
away from the gad model so it would

446
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,360
appear

447
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,959
that this small contribution to the

448
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,279
total data set is

449
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,519
suggesting that the data is not actually

450
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,519
uh it doesn't really fit this dipole

451
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,959
model

452
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,240
so just i said it's going to be a short

453
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,120
talk so just to wrap up the conclusion

454
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
there's obviously still

455
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
more work to be done here i haven't

456
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,120
shown you any any rock magnetic data

457
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,839
which i

458
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,639
have measured but not really analyzed

459
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,680
yet

460
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,480
um and we obviously need the organ dates

461
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,480
as well

462
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
um so the new data does not support the

463
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,720
guide hypothesis at high latitudes

464
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,800
and you can tell i just added this uh

465
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,399
the second point

466
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,880
following on from andy biggins talk

467
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,240
yesterday so the models i've shown you

468
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
these calculations for the

469
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
for the contributions from the octopus

470
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,279
and uh

471
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,040
quadruple field these are these are

472
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,399
calculated using the giant gaussian

473
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,959
process models

474
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
and a lot of people have used those uh

475
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,800
lease attacks and

476
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,759
kathy constable and i've in the paper

477
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,880
that i published i

478
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,320
i used one of the one of these models to

479
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,639
to do that um and perhaps

480
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
we should be not using these types of

481
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,320
models and moving away to some of the

482
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,920
ideas that andy said about

483
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,680
trying to um yeah trying to use maybe a

484
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,800
dynamic model to try and predict

485
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,600
the behavior especially at high

486
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,600
latitudes okay thank you for listening

487
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
bang on 15 minutes thank you for that

488
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,480
adrian it's a

489
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,839
very interesting talk so we time for a

490
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
quick question or two

491
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,680
i'll i'll ask a quick question if i may

492
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,079
um just about the um

493
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,199
uh your selection for the for the for

494
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,720
the gad model

495
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,399
um from pine what um were you specifying

496
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,120
certain age range were you

497
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,880
um strict on the data selection

498
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,320
technique so on

499
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,480
i wonder what you're comparing against

500
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
um

501
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,639
this is from memory because it's from

502
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,199
the 2017 paper but it's

503
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,639
it's we tell a data only so that's

504
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,360
obviously chucks out quite a lot of

505
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,120
stuff

506
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,959
zero to five actually it wasn't i think

507
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,160
we we removed the first thirty thousand

508
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,839
years so

509
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,279
thirty thousand years up to five million

510
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,800
years because obviously you buy

511
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
there's so much data from the first 30

512
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,240
000 years um

513
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,399
and then i think we have to have at

514
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,800
least three estimates

515
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,519
from a site to give it and then

516
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,600
obviously the

517
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
deviation less than 25 i'm not sure what

518
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
the value

519
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,679
is of how many having three points and a

520
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,120
deviation of less standard deviation

521
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
less than 25 percent that's getting a

522
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,520
bit

523
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
dodgy on the stats but that's thing that

524
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,439
was the criteria i'd have to check

525
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,720
what the other ones were yeah i think

526
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,520
those are the main ones

527
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,240
okay fair enough yeah um yeah now i'm

528
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,720
looking at

529
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,079
the databases should give you a fair

530
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,640
fair sampling from

531
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
russia and um and greenland and stuff

532
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,679
yeah i mean

533
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,360
just really very surprising results that

534
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,200
you show in that region like very

535
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,280
very low paleo intensities for such high

536
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,400
um high latitudes

537
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,799
so yeah i know

538
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
and well we know the thing is the new

539
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,840
data we've got

540
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
is low as well but it it doesn't really

541
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
disagree that much with the previous

542
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
data which is also low so you know i

543
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
don't think there's anything shocking

544
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,520
it's more

545
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
it's just a question of what's really

546
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,080
happening to the field at high

547
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,120
uh high latitudes and you know if you

548
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
look at the

549
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,600
if we just assume a gadfield at high

550
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,679
latitudes if you do a paleo

551
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,559
reconstruction i mean rna estimated that

552
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,480
you get a up to 500 kilometer

553
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,000
you know mismatch in where you're

554
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,520
predicting it should be

555
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,600
whereas if you've got a field that's not

556
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,919
quite a you know with a five percent

557
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,640
octopus quadruple component so you know

558
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,919
it could be

559
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,679
an issue for people who are using gad

560
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
we all a lot of people use gad right as

561
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,919
part of the as part of their paleo

562
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,280
geographic reconstructions and maybe

563
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,440
need to be a little bit more careful

564
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,799
with that in terms of

565
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
you know what's the error on you know

566
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,240
maybe it gives you a chance to move

567
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,520
things around a little bit more in your

568
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,799
reconstructions i i mean you know

569
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,480
potentially it could be because you're

570
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,640
between the flux patches right so your

571
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,280
high latitude flux patches which are

572
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,640
dominating dad you know or dominating

573
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,480
the the dipole

574
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,240
i suspect it is the flux patches and i

575
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,600
suspect you know using a dynamo model as

576
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,120
you were talking yesterday might be a

577
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,520
better way to try and make predictions

578
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,799
of what's expected at high latitudes

579
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,720
because i'm not sure these these

580
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,480
gaussian models are

581
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
i mean they're quite simple right so you

582
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
know not really capturing all the

583
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,160
features

584
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,840
yeah but it would be dynamo models would

585
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
need to have some

586
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,520
uh heterogeneity on the core mantle

587
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,400
boundary

588
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,640
to uh to to to get the flux patches to

589
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
be

590
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,559
stable i was going to say the flux

591
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,720
patches would have to be stable and

592
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:24,000
long-lived but that does that's quite

593
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,799
quite possible at least on these sorts

594
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,919
of times girls

595
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,919
tens of millions of years

596
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,919
you can just make time for just one more

597
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,799
quick question and we'll move on to the

598
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,799
flash posters

599
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,000
uh i have less of a quick question and

600
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,320
more of just a

601
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,679
blatant self-promotion but the new ggp

602
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,880
model that

603
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,919
we put out does have a sort of

604
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,799
some zonal non-zero components that do

605
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,000
try to match

606
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,880
at least um the the cromwell

607
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,559
uh inclination anomaly record so like i

608
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,640
said blatant self-promotion but there

609
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,440
are some ggp options out there that do

610
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,000
kind of

611
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,000
capture some of this that was about it

1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,080
okay

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,040
so uh thank you everyone for coming to

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,639
uh what will be

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,639
uh the last um uh magnet seminar

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,720
of of 2020 uh we've had a successful run

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,160
and a great turnout for everybody so

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,680
uh thank you all uh very much for uh for

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,119
your support

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,199
um for those who who are new to uh

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,679
these seminars uh we'll have

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,880
presentations that are about 20 to

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,880
25 to 30 minutes in length um i kindly

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,120
ask that you keep your microphones

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
uh muted um during the presentation so

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,520
that we don't interrupt

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,800
uh the speaker uh following the

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
uh the seminar will have us a 10 to 15

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,120
minute

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,000
uh discussion if you do not want to

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,199
uh unmute yourself to ask a micro a task

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,960
a question

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,280
we will answer we can take questions

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,160
through the uh the text chat

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,719
so just simply add no mic um to your

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
question

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,400
and either myself or anita uh we'll read

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
them out

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,119
um as always we have life and all sorts

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,799
of things going on around us so if you

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
do have to leave halfway through

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,240
it's absolutely not a problem uh just

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
you just need to go

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
uh and just a reminder for the record

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,400
that uh the seminars are recorded

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,000
um and at the end of the seminar we will

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080
have time um

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,840
to chat and catch up uh with everybody

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,400
if you're interested in that

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,280
and this part of of the magnet series

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
isn't recorded

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,320
and so won't be made publicly available

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,960
we turn the recording off

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,280
and we can all just uh chit chat and uh

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,320
relax

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
um and so i'm very pleased to introduce

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,520
our speaker our last speaker for

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,399
uh 2020 erdo kia tima from the

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
university

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,600
of uh turin and she will be talking

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,799
about

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,240
archaeomagnetic research in italy so i

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,960
will head over to

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,960
iftakia okay thank you so much

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,920
can you see my screen

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,920
yes yeah we can

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,920
yes sir i can see your screen and i knew

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,920
it again

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,000
okay thank you so much first of all i

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,640
would like to thank

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
a lot greg and anita for giving me this

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,680
opportunity

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,400
to talk here today a little bit about

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,280
automagnetic research in italy

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
and my talk today will be a very brief

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
overview

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,160
of the available up to now

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
electromagnetic data from italy

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,360
presenting some recent advances

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
ecobritis with some future perspectives

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
i would like to say that what i'm going

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,599
to present is not just the result of my

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
personal work but is the work of a lot

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,680
of researchers that during the last

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
decades they have dedicated a part of

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
their research

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,000
on establishing promoting and advancing

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,920
electromagnetic research in italy

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
and also collaboration with a lot of

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
archaeologists that i would like to

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,599
personally

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,120
acknowledge a lot okay

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,440
as we all know already very well uh

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,599
reconstructing and understanding how the

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,239
earth's magnetic field was changing in

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,920
the past

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,959
is particularly interesting and

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,920
important from one part you can give us

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,360
information

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,120
indirect information about the processes

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
that take place in the corporate

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
boundary

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,360
and offer some insights about the origin

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,400
and nature of the geomagnetic field

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,560
while from the other part one we once

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,599
we are able to know how theirs magnetic

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
field was changing

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
in the past we can then use this

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
information

99
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,360
as a dating tool useful for different

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,760
fields of earth sciences of course in

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,000
order to retrieve information about how

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
the earth's magnetic field was changing

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
in the past and mostly in the time

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,519
periods where no direct

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,760
measurements are available it is

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,959
necessary to study

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,879
several kinds of well-dated material

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,599
such as for example archaeological

109
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,799
material volcanic rocks

110
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,280
lacrosse stream or marine sediments or

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
other kind of natural archives such as

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,160
failovers

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,800
for example i think that we can say that

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
among all these geomagnetic field

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
recorders

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,320
we can consider acid base lace volcanic

117
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,199
rocks as

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
quite freezing sources of information as

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,680
they mainly

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,720
present three important advantages

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,600
first of all they carry a quite strong

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
and stable film aroma and magnetization

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,639
acquired

124
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,080
during the heating at high temperatures

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
and subsequent cooling

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,400
in the presence of the ambient icing

127
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
field

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,759
they and that's of course the case of

129
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
volcanic rocks or

130
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,520
of archaeological materials such as big

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,560
clays

132
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,600
they can give us also very well dated

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,880
reliable sport records and as for

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,160
example the famous

135
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,560
vesuvius eruption that destroyed

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
at the same time preserved forever the

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,680
ancient city of pompeii

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,479
and we know very well that of 79.80

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,199
so this way we can have a quite reliable

140
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,360
very well dated sport report

141
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
and such kind of materials can also be

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
very useful

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,680
as they can give us information about

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,960
the full geomagnetic field vector

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,400
including both directional and absolute

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,000
intensity data

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,880
and that's of course the case when we're

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,199
talking about materials still found

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,840
in situ we can say that from this point

150
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
of view

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,400
italy is a quite lucky country is a

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,520
country with a very

153
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
rich and long cultural heritage with a

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
lot

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
and the important archaeological sites

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,280
that can be potential offer

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,919
a great large number of art magnetic

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,759
data

159
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,840
but at the same time italy is

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,639
characterized also by a long

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
and important volcanic activity made due

162
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,600
to the two

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,039
important and of course still active

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
italian volcanoes that

165
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,759
is aetna and vesuvius

166
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,160
so from this point of view and

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
since many decades a lot of researchers

168
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,840
have done

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,759
great work and we have a lot of uh

170
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,360
magnetic investigations coming from

171
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,520
volcanic rocks

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
well we can say that most recently a

173
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
great interest

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,400
has also been focused on the study of

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,520
archaeological artifacts

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,440
nevertheless even though these are among

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
the most reliable to magnetic field

178
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,199
recorders

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,840
still we can say that often errors or

180
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,479
problems

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,240
are related with the paramagnetic

182
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,599
records coming from

183
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,160
these records problems that may be

184
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
related either to their sampling or to

185
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
the

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,160
reliability of their rotating or

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
different to some

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,319
disturbances caused by local

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,520
and local problems as for example the

190
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
strongly magnetized

191
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,720
volcanic areas so for this reason

192
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,639
and in order to be able to collect the

193
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
most reliable data

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,160
very recently in italy we have tried to

195
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
combine

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,919
an updated data set uh including only

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,520
available up to now data come from both

198
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,800
archaeological material

199
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,680
and organic rocks actually what we have

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
done is a quite

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,240
crazy thing because we have not just

202
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,080
used the global data sets but we try to

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
retrieve one by one

204
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
all the original publications read them

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
carefully

206
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,400
in order to obtain all those metadata

207
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,199
information that would help us

208
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,520
to evaluate one by one the reliability

209
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,680
of the available data

210
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,440
and when i refer to the reliability and

211
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
quality of the reference data

212
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,639
i just i don't just refer to the quality

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,280
of the experimental techniques applied

214
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
but also the reliability the quality of

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,160
the dating

216
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,599
of such of such records we have paint a

217
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,360
particular attention

218
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:14,319
on their density protocols used

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,520
looking trying to understand and and and

220
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,680
find out if

221
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,680
necessary corrections have been applied

222
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,639
so from this compilation and this uh

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,319
careful investigation some interesting

224
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,319
results came out

225
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,960
as far as the data from volcanic rocks

226
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,959
are concerned as it was expected

227
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,560
we can see that most of the data come

228
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,880
from the two

229
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,000
active italian volcanoes from ethnic

230
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,000
venus

231
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we have some records from strawberry

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,800
which means aeolian islands

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
and we have also a few data from the ski

234
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,160
eruption

235
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,000
however maybe the most interesting

236
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,360
result is that

237
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,080
we found out that only 57

238
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,320
of the italian volcanic magnetic records

239
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,160
come from well-dated eruptions

240
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,519
which means that almost half of the

241
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,440
available volcanic

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,240
data from volcanic rocks come from

243
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,680
eruptions that their traditional age has

244
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,880
been questioned or even

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,680
changed based on geological evidence or

246
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,800
automagnetic dating

247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,800
as far as na are concerned the data from

248
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,399
archaeological artifacts

249
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,519
we can see the data directional data

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,880
mostly come

251
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,399
from in sea to bake clay structures

252
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,720
such as skins health ovens while we have

253
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,399
also some data coming from in sea to

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,839
burn to sentiments

255
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,800
some burnt walls or some um

256
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
validated moral paintings what is

257
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,399
however interesting

258
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,320
is that as far as the density data are

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,560
concerned that we know that for

260
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
obtaining acure density results it's not

261
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,519
necessary to collect in

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,440
situ oriented material still most of the

263
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,240
italian density data come

264
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,360
from in-situ structures such as skins or

265
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
ovals

266
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,399
we have some data from historical from

267
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,279
brics

268
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
from historical data while only 15

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,720
percent

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
of the available italian intensity data

271
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,800
come

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
from pottery shells

273
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,800
okay if we plot now the available data

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,720
from

275
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,560
italian archaeological sites that you

276
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
can see here illustrated with the blue

277
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,959
color

278
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,040
and together with the data with the

279
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,680
volcanic from the volcanic rocks

280
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,160
illustrated here with a red color we can

281
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
see that

282
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,160
we will have a quite good agreement

283
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
however we can also

284
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,440
very easily notice that most of the

285
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
available data

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,920
are concentrated the last 3000 years

287
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,200
while if we go back in time

288
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,600
the available data are extremely scarce

289
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
actually as far as the density data are

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,320
concerned they are extremely

291
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,480
few and for some millennia who have no

292
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,320
data at all

293
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
if you have a more careful look at the

294
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,959
data i would say these are

295
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
almost the only data available for the

296
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,640
last uh

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,600
time period before uh the first million

298
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,160
in bc there are some data coming from

299
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,320
a burnt sentiments published by copper

300
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,600
italia in 2014

301
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
well i would like to point your

302
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,320
attention to the oldest

303
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,920
full vector geomagnetic field data that

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
we have from italy and come

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,360
from this interesting archaeological

306
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,839
site of portunovo

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
i would like to spend some few words on

308
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,640
this

309
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
here is the archaeological site of

310
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,600
portonovo as you can see

311
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,640
it is situated in the adriatic coast of

312
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,560
italy and it's quite interesting site as

313
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,760
archaeological excavation

314
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,640
proteolyte a very large number of small

315
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,000
ovens

316
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,760
these are the small circular ovens made

317
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,920
by bay clay that you can see

318
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,240
here if i'm not wrong they were

319
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,200
excavated more than 20

320
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,120
such structures but according to

321
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,360
archaeologists and archaeological

322
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
evidence they were probably used for the

323
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
production

324
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,480
of food cooking or production

325
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,600
of the cooking of bread so actually one

326
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,800
of the reputation

327
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
could be that we have a very big

328
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,399
bakery of the neolithic period more than

329
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,160
7000 years ago

330
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,480
what is particularly interesting from

331
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,800
this site apart from the fact that this

332
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,639
is a very rare example of very well

333
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,560
preserved underground ovens from

334
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,720
neolithic period

335
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,560
the good thing is that archaeologists

336
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,920
have found a great number of

337
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,639
seeds and cereals there so

338
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,480
it can be this site has been very

339
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,880
precisely dated

340
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
and it belongs to the early neolithic

341
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,399
period between

342
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,720
5 600 to 5 300 bc

343
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,560
for ecomagnetic investigation we have

344
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
collected saints from three

345
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
of these ovens that you can see here

346
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
just to show you

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,399
some very briefly some magnetic

348
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,279
mineralogy results will have

349
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,040
a great low positivity mineral we have

350
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,079
the dominant sources of soft

351
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,240
components and we have obtained also

352
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,959
very nice a different diagrams

353
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,519
uh quite straight lines that

354
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,200
goes through the origin of our diagrams

355
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,240
that gave us also nice

356
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,480
mean direction as you can see here

357
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,120
from this side and we were lucky that it

358
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,959
was possible also to uh have a accurate

359
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
density determination thanks to the

360
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,760
collaboration of

361
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,279
my colleague pierre camps from the

362
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
montpelier university

363
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,320
that used the multi-specimen method to

364
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,880
obtain

365
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,519
argue density results so actually is the

366
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
oldest

367
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,560
full vector data that we'll have from

368
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,440
italy so far

369
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,320
okay going back to our data set as you

370
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
can imagine

371
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,199
we have concentrated our interest in the

372
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
last three thousand years as for order

373
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
periods

374
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,680
the data are extremely scarce to make

375
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,480
any further

376
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,720
considerations and we've tried to apply

377
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,360
some selection criteria in order to

378
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
collect

379
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,120
the most reliable data

380
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,920
of course there is a great discussion

381
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,199
which are the best selection criteria to

382
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,440
to apply definitely if we apply very

383
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,279
strict selection criteria that means

384
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,480
that we will keep the best

385
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,279
absolutely the best data but at the same

386
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
time

387
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
it's most probably that we will erase or

388
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,839
reject

389
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
most of our data so in this case we try

390
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,639
to

391
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,720
to find a compromise and we have applied

392
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,360
a selection criteria we have

393
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,639
selected those data that come from a

394
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
number of specimens

395
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,240
equal or higher than five and

396
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,360
um i have to say that going back to the

397
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,680
original

398
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
publications very often it's not so

399
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,720
clear

400
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,680
the number of specimens and the number

401
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,440
of independently oriented samples

402
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,399
so in this case we have chosen five

403
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,600
a quite large number of spacemen hoping

404
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,839
that this way

405
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
most of our results will not come from

406
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,000
just one

407
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,160
single sample okay some selection

408
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,720
criteria based on the alpha 95

409
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,839
angle of confidence and the standard

410
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,560
deviation

411
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
the age error was equal or higher than

412
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,160
200 years

413
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,000
and we also paid particular attention on

414
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,199
the acute density protocol

415
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
applied i have to say that we have

416
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,839
rejected all volcanic rocks that come

417
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,920
from

418
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,320
eruptions that their age has been

419
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,680
questioned or it's not so reliable

420
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,160
and all those data that were missing

421
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,839
metadata information in order to be able

422
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,880
to evaluate the

423
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,800
reliability asking

424
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,519
you can imagine after this election

425
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,839
criteria a tragedy happened

426
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,279
all great majority of our data were

427
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,480
rejected

428
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,759
so for this reason we have decided

429
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,720
to try to enhance italian data set

430
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,120
with data from nearby countries and

431
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,199
mostly cover the time periods that were

432
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,320
fully investigated in italy with

433
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,720
data coming from sites that are included

434
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,079
in 1 000 kilometers radius

435
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,600
around the terrible mutable is situated

436
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,519
here illustrated with the red

437
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
star it's situated more or less in the

438
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,279
center of italy

439
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,440
and using this data from the nearby

440
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,440
countries applying the same selection

441
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,360
criteria with those from the italian

442
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,480
data set who have a total of 594

443
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
directional

444
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,079
a data and 94 intensity high quality

445
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,480
reference data

446
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,600
if you have a look on this data you can

447
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
see here

448
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,040
these are the with the light blue are

449
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,480
the data coming from

450
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,360
italian archaeomagnetic sites both

451
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,839
archaeological sites and volcanic rocks

452
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,959
while

453
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,639
with the open dark blue dots are the

454
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,120
data from the nearby

455
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,880
countries and you can see that we have a

456
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,639
quite nice agreement

457
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,279
which means that most more or less our

458
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,919
selection container seems to have bored

459
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
and we can nicely see some clear

460
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,240
features

461
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,160
of the geomagnetic field vector

462
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
as far as the directional data are

463
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,839
concerned

464
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,400
if we have a more careful look on the

465
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,839
density data we can still see that there

466
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,679
are some time periods

467
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:27,360
where very few data are available mostly

468
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,319
periods before 400 bc but also have an

469
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,480
important gap

470
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:36,400
around 880.

471
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,720
using this data as reference data

472
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,919
and thanks to the precious help of

473
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,360
felipe lanos

474
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:46,000
i will have constructed a continuous

475
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,360
smooth circular variation cover curve

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,160
covering the last three

477
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,600
three thousand years by using the basin

478
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,320
statistics

479
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,280
as you can see and of course it is

480
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,120
expected

481
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,280
for the time periods where we have a lot

482
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,520
of data the reference

483
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,039
reference curves are well constrained

484
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,240
and accompanied by

485
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,240
um by small uh error envelopes

486
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,280
one it will have a low at the time

487
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,400
periods that you have

488
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,200
a very few data the curves are not well

489
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,880
constrained

490
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:21,039
and are accompanied by quite large

491
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,840
error envelopes if we compare now these

492
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,000
curves with some of the regional and

493
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,520
global to magnetic field models

494
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,039
we can see we can see a general good

495
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,200
agreement for most of uh of the period

496
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,120
however there are also some important

497
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,320
differences as for example

498
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,320
this um this decrease

499
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,400
in declination that is quite well

500
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,120
constrained by the italian curve

501
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,919
but we cannot clearly see in the models

502
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,640
or some

503
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,440
discrepancies also in the actual density

504
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,840
curves

505
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,240
that of course mainly due to the small

506
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,480
number of the italian reference data

507
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,520
available so for some periods

508
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,280
so i would just

509
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,360
i would like also to have a small

510
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,760
reference or to magnetic dating

511
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,520
as one of the most well-known

512
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,559
applications of arctic magnetism

513
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,880
is arco magnetic dating and i would like

514
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,280
to show you this uh recent the results

515
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,679
of this recent study of this

516
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,679
king that has been excavated at canoza

517
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,720
de gulia in the southern part

518
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,280
of italy actually this is a sandwich

519
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,320
that was carried out almost a year ago

520
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,400
on october

521
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,960
and 2019 and it's actually my last

522
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,000
sampling campaign before being closed at

523
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,039
home for several

524
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,440
months due to this unfortunate covet

525
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,320
maintaining situations so i'm happy to

526
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,799
show you

527
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,080
these results it's a sampling cam

528
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,640
performed in a

529
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,400
collaboration with dr italum tony from

530
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,240
surprise details of pojo and the

531
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
archaeologist from

532
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,320
cooperativa archaeology that i would

533
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
like to to thank a lot for giving me

534
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,880
this

535
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,640
opportunity to collect material from

536
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,760
this um

537
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,280
from this structure this is a site that

538
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,799
has been excavated and has been

539
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
discovered as often

540
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,000
happens during the last day decades due

541
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,480
to

542
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
the it's a rescue excavation and found

543
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
due to them

544
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,960
walks for a construction of a road

545
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,120
between

546
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,480
android and canosa and as often happens

547
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,559
very often before the the start of

548
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,679
these works there was a preliminary

549
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,559
archaeological

550
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,559
investigation and they were found three

551
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,840
kings i will show just the results from

552
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,679
the first kill

553
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
that as you can see is quite well

554
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,200
preserved keen

555
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
here we have the performium here is the

556
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,919
main combustion chamber and

557
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,919
this nice arch that we still preserved

558
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,720
and this king was most probably used for

559
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,520
the production of brakes

560
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,320
for archaeomagnetic investigation we

561
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,000
have taken

562
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,640
15 bricks from the main combustion

563
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,039
chamber

564
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,799
all of them oriented in situ with

565
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,400
magnetic and solar compass and

566
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,400
infiniometer

567
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,320
here you can see some of the results

568
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,799
obtained or have a nice

569
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,320
and strong magnetization nice linear

570
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,400
zener diagrams

571
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,559
and we have obtained a mean direction

572
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,000
well constrained mean

573
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,640
direction that then we have used to date

574
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,039
the the last heating of course the last

575
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,440
use

576
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,919
of the skin by comparison with the new

577
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,000
italian circular variation curves

578
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,960
and here you can see the comparison of

579
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,760
the declination

580
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,000
inclination and then here the

581
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,320
combination to probability density

582
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,760
and for the dating we have used the

583
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,480
archaeogetic matlab

584
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,520
tool and we can see that we have three

585
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,840
possible

586
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,360
dated intervals that based on the

587
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,919
archaeological context

588
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,640
of this structure we can say that most

589
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,640
probably

590
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:59,200
it was last used sometime between 480

591
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,440
and 530 the good thing with this

592
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
with this structure is that the

593
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,240
archaeologists going on with their

594
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,960
excavation

595
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,679
they have found in the brief volume of

596
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,880
this

597
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,600
kiln this characteristic rectangular

598
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,720
brick

599
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,919
with this nice sign of p that is

600
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,200
a quite a characteristic it's an

601
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,919
identification sign of the production

602
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,960
workshop

603
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,080
and it can further uh confirms that this

604
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,039
king belongs

605
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,679
more or less to the 5th to 6th century

606
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,520
80

607
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,919
which means that we are more or less in

608
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,000
the correct way

609
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,520
concluding if i would like to say a few

610
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,480
words about the future

611
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,440
i think the best thing i can say is that

612
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,919
there is still

613
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,960
a lot of work that we have to do

614
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,679
definitely

615
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,559
future research in italy should be

616
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,080
focused

617
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,640
on obtaining new high quality data

618
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,919
if possible reference data from time

619
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,120
periods before

620
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,240
the first millennium bc where the data

621
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,320
will have up to now are very scarce it

622
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,559
would be particularly important to

623
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,480
to try to obtain more high quality

624
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,880
archery density data

625
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,840
and it will be interesting to have more

626
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,320
data about

627
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,799
the beginning of the first millennium bc

628
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,200
in order to try to investigate and to

629
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,400
see

630
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,039
if the iron age levantine anomaly is

631
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
also

632
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,679
seen in the italian peninsula and i

633
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,799
would say that would be also very

634
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,080
important to have

635
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,559
full vector uh geomagnetic field data

636
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,760
from

637
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,080
the same well-dated material

638
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,960
definitely a particular rotation should

639
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,679
be always

640
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,159
paid on the dating of the reference data

641
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,520
that

642
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,320
is very important and magnetic data sets

643
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,679
databases and live organisms that should

644
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,200
be continuously

645
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,159
updated and fitted

646
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,679
here are some references and i would

647
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,640
like to thank you very much for your

648
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,799
attention

649
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,799
here you can see a photo from torino of

650
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,840
course it has nothing to do with dark

651
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,440
magnetism but

652
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,840
during these difficult times that we

653
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,640
cannot travel i thought that

654
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,279
magnet seminars could also contribute on

655
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,440
make us

656
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:18,559
traveling a little bit around the world

657
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:21,679
thank you so much for your attention

658
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,080
thank you so much here we um

659
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,880
thank you a big round of applause for

660
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,000
every kia

661
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,720
thanks for your presentation um

662
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,600
so if anybody has a question can drop on

663
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,039
the

664
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,159
chat box or raise their hands

665
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:41,440
and i'm sure fdk would be happy to

666
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,440
answer your questions

667
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,880
so i will jump in with a quick question

668
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
because i i as a host i can't actually

669
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,600
raise my hand

670
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,600
but um i i kind of noticed that there is

671
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,240
um a bit of a split uh obviously in

672
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,000
in the distribution of the data north

673
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,360
south because

674
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,559
vesuvius and aetna are are

675
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,919
located in southern italy and

676
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:12,960
the volcanic data tend to

677
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,159
to come from the younger ages and given

678
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,080
that that essentially your

679
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
your data sampling is across a diameter

680
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,600
of about 2 000

681
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,880
kilometers i'm wondering is there is

682
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,520
there any difference

683
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,559
uh between the northern regions and the

684
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,520
southern regions

685
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,880
and can you pick out more fine scale

686
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,440
detail

687
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
in in the data sets or is there not

688
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,320
enough data to really look at

689
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,799
that north-south divide

690
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,400
now actually i have not noticed any any

691
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,320
systematic or regular

692
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,600
differences between the the north and

693
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,720
the site

694
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,960
and the the southern part and

695
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
i have to say that there is not even

696
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,200
very

697
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,919
big differences between uh automagnetic

698
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,000
data from

699
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,960
archaeological material and volcanic

700
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,640
rocks

701
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,600
what then i i would have tried also to

702
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,039
use a smaller

703
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,600
radius to to be more concentrated to the

704
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,880
italian territory but unfortunately

705
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,840
it didn't enrich a lot our data set you

706
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,279
can see who have

707
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,120
huge huge missing of data but

708
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,400
it is interesting however to know this

709
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,640
is the great as

710
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,120
greg said most of the volcanic rocks

711
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,159
come from recent um

712
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,840
more recent time periods and uh if you

713
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,840
have a look here

714
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,360
we can see that even the data coming

715
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,720
from the very recent

716
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,279
periods almost the last few hundred

717
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,720
years still will have a great discretion

718
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,880
of the data

719
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,159
as far as the density results are

720
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
concerned

721
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,360
a lot of these data that you can see

722
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,440
here however come from

723
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,559
qualitative eruptions and the many

724
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,559
researchers have used

725
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,919
these eruptions to to test their density

726
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,240
results or intensity techniques

727
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,520
however yes you have a lot of dispersion

728
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,080
and i also have to

729
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,000
to say that the tragedy that happened

730
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,760
during the rejection of the data

731
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,080
due to quality criteria really um

732
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,000
it was very important as far as the

733
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,760
density data are concerned

734
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,840
and mainly the density data from

735
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,840
volcanic rocks

736
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,360
so do we have uh any uh further

737
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
questions

738
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,480
there is one in the chat that i can read

739
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,159
yeah

740
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,880
oh you go so it's uh by elizabeth

741
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,799
uh sandra elizabeth i'm sorry the usual

742
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,840
difference in thermal stability

743
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,240
and therefore also in the stability

744
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,880
reliability

745
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,360
in the data obtained from kills for

746
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
breath

747
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,679
for bread baking brick production and

748
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,720
shells

749
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,880
yes the the stability of thermal

750
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,000
remnants magnetization of kings

751
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,080
really is really excellent in

752
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,240
almost all material that i have studied

753
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,960
but also the material from

754
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,720
literature and data from literature they

755
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,559
are very very stable

756
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,840
and i have to say that i have noticed

757
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,039
also the quality of their

758
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,320
intensity data coming from from

759
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:23,279
bricks and from

760
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,279
kings is really good it's really good

761
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,000
they're not they're very stable probably

762
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,000
heating and reheating and

763
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,480
high temperatures make them particularly

764
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,480
stable

765
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,840
okay thank you i can see richard holm

766
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,600
waving his hands

767
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,039
uh his physical hand not the electronic

768
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,399
hand yeah

769
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,120
um hive doc here um

770
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,799
i um have a slightly different view

771
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,520
generally on selection criteria than

772
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,960
many

773
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,640
um when you do your model what happens

774
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,360
if you test all the data you've rejected

775
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,960
against your model

776
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,840
well the truth is that by rejecting our

777
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,960
data

778
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,000
what happened is that we mostly rejected

779
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,520
data that were clear outliers

780
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,480
and data that even with them

781
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,679
with easy observation would be rejected

782
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,360
because they were really

783
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,559
outside if we take them out

784
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,279
the difference is not such so important

785
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,360
it's not so important what the we

786
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,240
noticed however is that the selection

787
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,159
criteria on the density data

788
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:41,840
it is much improved then

789
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,840
the agreement among the available data

790
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:50,720
thank you you're welcome

791
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,720
so we have a question by shelby

792
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,799
so in the chat and she asked when you

793
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,880
were doing their archival work

794
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,480
were you reanalyzing their vector

795
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,720
average or accepting them as it is

796
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
i didn't get when i i revised the

797
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,960
previous data if i

798
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,679
revised also the vectors no no no no i

799
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
have not

800
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,000
taken the the original

801
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,679
uh measurements i i had no access we had

802
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,480
no access of the original measurements

803
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,799
we just

804
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,520
evaluated the information given in the

805
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,360
original

806
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,960
and papers saying about the reliability

807
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,240
how many specimens

808
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,080
if there were doubts on the

809
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
archaeological age

810
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,440
if other works later on changed the

811
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,919
previous psychological age as

812
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,720
sometimes happens also because as far

813
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,320
it's the

814
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,159
reliability of dating it does not

815
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,720
concern only the volcanic rocks very

816
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,960
often

817
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,080
archaeological excavations that go on

818
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,360
more data come

819
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,320
up and so the initial evaluation of the

820
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,039
dating may be

821
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,240
changed or reevaluated as far as more

822
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,399
dating results come

823
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,480
up more excavation findings come up

824
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,960
that's why i say that the database are a

825
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,799
live organism should be continuously

826
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,799
feed it and update it

827
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,799
so um so i just have a follow-up

828
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,960
question

829
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:17,360
so the the do you reject the site

830
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,159
or the studies that have re-evaluated

831
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,200
the dates

832
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,519
or you just use the re-evaluated dates i

833
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,720
use the re-evaluated dates

834
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,519
yeah and follow up to about that i was

835
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,480
sorry for excuse me for a volcanic rocks

836
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,440
when the dates

837
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,279
were evaluated re-evaluated based on

838
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,240
automagnetic data

839
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,840
they were not included because otherwise

840
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,840
would be a circular reasoning

841
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,519
and obviously now there is a the new

842
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
radiocarbon curve

843
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,640
from rhymer 2020 so we kind of have to

844
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
re

845
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,120
recalibrate everything that we've done

846
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,120
so

847
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,799
i agree with you it's a living organism

848
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,840
in the database and like max

849
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,360
brown can colleagues can

850
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,240
prove that and also obviously andy begin

851
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,919
so uh sandra elizabethton raised her

852
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,000
hand

853
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,799
uh yeah yeah um no i have a question to

854
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,840
the

855
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,960
you showed your data for the intensity

856
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,799
and i there's for the 400

857
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
years you have a gap of 10 microtesla in

858
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,880
your data

859
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,159
so from where you compare like the

860
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,519
literature data

861
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,799
and then your data points and

862
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,039
for one i think for 500 years you have

863
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,200
with two data points and a difference of

864
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,519
around 10 micro tesla

865
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,480
how do you explain that or what do you

866
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,519
think is an

867
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,720
explanation for that you are referring

868
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,240
in this data here

869
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,960
yes yes that's very interesting because

870
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,039
um

871
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,480
particularly for this time period that

872
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,320
has been

873
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,200
i was very curious and it's very sad at

874
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,360
the same time because for this

875
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,519
880 it has been already observed

876
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,519
like in the barrier peninsula a quite

877
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,799
high density

878
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,519
value around 880 and i was particularly

879
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,559
interesting

880
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,399
in this period but unfortunately

881
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,600
we don't have enough data to to make

882
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,440
conclusions

883
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,120
this data one comes from a study in

884
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,480
in france if i'm not wrong and one in

885
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,880
switzerland

886
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,159
and they are they have a different

887
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,519
synthetic i think

888
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,640
less than than 50 years or something

889
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,120
like that

890
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,640
both of these data seems to be of high

891
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,440
quality data

892
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,919
this one gave very high values and this

893
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,519
one

894
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,799
quite low values but i had no re

895
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,279
reason to to reject them okay so yes

896
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,039
thanks about actually referring to the

897
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,760
500 years

898
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,960
of magnetic data now it was a nice

899
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,960
explanation thanks

900
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,159
but uh i was actually not curious about

901
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,320
the 500 years

902
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,880
this difference is quite particular

903
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,880
that's why

904
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:15,119
you're talking about 580 yeah

905
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,599
this data okay yeah okay this thing has

906
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,760
two data from italy it do from my i'm

907
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,359
not sure if it's france or not

908
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,720
but once again when we went to to to see

909
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,040
what's what's wrong there was no nothing

910
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,079
wrong

911
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,280
that was easy to to

912
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,480
to detect let's say i

913
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,440
i am afraid that very often and

914
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,000
let's say disturbances on the data apart

915
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,320
from

916
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,560
laboratory techniques or laboratory

917
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,520
problems that cannot be detected

918
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,200
it's very often um a problem of the

919
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,720
dating that we cannot

920
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,800
really see it passes it passes very

921
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,800
easily the selection criteria but

922
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
maybe it's not so precise

923
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,560
so it's more probably a dating problem

924
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,680
which okay i don't know but it could be

925
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,480
it could be

926
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:16,079
yes thanks very much you are welcome

927
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,400
thank you uh so we have a follow-up

928
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,520
you want to say something yes i was just

929
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,839
talking about the basic

930
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,280
data i wanted to say that also it's

931
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,839
quite sad that for the

932
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,160
so interesting period of the beginning

933
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,520
of the last millennium we just have one

934
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,760
single data so

935
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:39,040
anyway more will come more confident

936
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,240
um so we have shelby

937
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,280
asking a follow-up question and

938
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,119
she asks uh did you use the past

939
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,359
magnetic statistical method as a filter

940
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,480
what is the past statistical method

941
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,200
sorry

942
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,040
past magnetic statistical method as a

943
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,599
filter

944
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,280
i i don't know what is the past magnetic

945
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:06,160
statistical

946
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,160
i'm not quite sure uh

947
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:15,040
oh here here like the magstep or pcs

948
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,760
pcis yes see

949
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,359
for my for my own data i have used the

950
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,880
principal component

951
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,000
analysis while for the literature

952
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,800
data i just have taken the the mean mean

953
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,320
values calculated by the authors the the

954
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
main point of our

955
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,119
update compilation was to understand if

956
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,400
the reliability of these data

957
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,720
uh those data were reliable but

958
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,920
we have not recalculated the

959
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,320
intellectual

960
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:49,839
data this is certainly be

961
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,800
an an ad value but it's a very time

962
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,440
consuming

963
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,079
and it requires the original data to be

964
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,320
available

965
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,480
which are only available in magic and

966
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,800
not uh

967
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,200
and i don't know what's exact numbers

968
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,800
but i i bet not so many

969
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,000
so shelby says there is a lot of great

970
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,599
work thank you for compiling

971
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,960
this data nice overview from kathy

972
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,000
great work congratulations a success oh

973
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,040
here uh from

974
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,720
despina condo pulo sorry if i

975
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,760
pronounce it wrong a question on 600

976
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,960
800 lack of data

977
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,079
uh yes i'm just surprised to see that

978
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,400
the intensity data have this big

979
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,599
empty space here uh what about the

980
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,599
geneva entire

981
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,640
data of medieval

982
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,280
yes they're here these

983
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,560
are the the very recently published data

984
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,160
by zenith

985
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,400
collaborators in 2002 20. no no no sorry

986
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,400
sorry

987
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,119
no i don't mean the italian data i mean

988
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,079
the french pottery data

989
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,599
which if i remember well are situated

990
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,800
somewhere

991
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,760
around eight hundred and one on

992
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,400
and because most of the french data are

993
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,240
included

994
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,920
in your confidence circle so

995
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,280
if i recall well uh there should be data

996
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
around between 800 and 1000 from french

997
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,960
pottery

998
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,760
and i can go back to the original

999
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,640
publication anyway uh just an

1000
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,599
observation

1001
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,480
we have the same difficulty in obtaining

1002
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,760
intensity

1003
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,119
data from greece within

1004
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,160
the period 600 800

1005
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,599
because of several reasons there

1006
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,720
is a lack of material and in this way

1007
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:54,320
we cannot catch the supposed

1008
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,720
high value around 700 to 800

1009
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,560
but i will really i'm very surprised

1010
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,720
that we look to the literature

1011
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,720
sorry for this gap anyway thank you for

1012
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,400
your nice presentation of nokia

1013
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,119
we have the opportunity to talk about

1014
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,440
that later or in another one

1015
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,400
thank you so much thank you so much it's

1016
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,079
interesting yes

1017
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,000
it's interesting it's sad that there are

1018
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,560
not a lot of data for that

1019
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,560
period i have to say that the selection

1020
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,599
criteria applied about the five

1021
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,960
specimens cut off a lot of data as well

1022
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,640
then the selection criteria

1023
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,640
rejected a lot of data most of them

1024
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,000
because of the smaller number of

1025
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,680
specimens

1026
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and then and

1027
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,800
then

1028
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,160
[Music]

1029
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,160
the standard deviation value but mostly

1030
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,160
because of the small number of specimens

1031
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,960
thank you we have a question of max

1032
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,320
brown that i almost missed

1033
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,040
sorry so he asked can you comment on

1034
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,320
whether the

1035
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:02,960
bayesian model fit over fits the data

1036
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,960
could a simpler model have a good fit

1037
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,880
we haven't tried it tried another model

1038
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,119
who have tried

1039
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,119
the space and reconstruction and i think

1040
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,920
it fits quite a while the data but

1041
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,280
of course it fits well the data when we

1042
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,400
have a lot of data

1043
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,440
when we don't have a lot of data it

1044
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,520
doesn't

1045
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,800
fit also here with the two results you

1046
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,359
can see we have a very

1047
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,680
um large error envelope and

1048
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,359
also in other time periods it cannot

1049
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,240
perfectly fit the data but when you have

1050
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,079
a lot of data

1051
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,079
i think it fits well

1052
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,480
thank you so uh we have a a question

1053
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,520
from javier and then

1054
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,520
andrei costa of ray say his hand so

1055
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,690
[Music]

1056
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,680
trm data with the historical data set

1057
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,160
within your spherical region like junker

1058
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,760
at

1059
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,880
2003 or eastmac database

1060
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,599
if if i have used historical data that's

1061
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,000
the question

1062
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,520
because uh the question sorry for the

1063
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,560
last three four centuries have you

1064
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,280
compared the

1065
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,960
trm data with historical data set within

1066
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,079
your spherical region

1067
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,800
no we no we have not used either in the

1068
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,280
either in the calculation or in the

1069
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,200
comparison the historical data actually

1070
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,119
uh for these very recent periods uh

1071
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,319
we have just used in all our caps are

1072
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,160
based only on

1073
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,920
archaeomagnetic data either from

1074
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,400
archaeological material or for volcanic

1075
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,400
roots

1076
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,400
and historical data are not included

1077
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:53,119
okay thank you andrei

1078
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:56,800
thank you for this nice nice talk

1079
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,599
i wonder uh did you try to

1080
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,000
plot your intensity data as a function

1081
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,240
of

1082
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,920
the material you use for

1083
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:12,480
for intensity i mean separately for

1084
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:16,480
kilns uh barter resent etc

1085
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,400
that's a good idea no we don't wanna

1086
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,599
it would be really interesting to see

1087
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,280
because

1088
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:27,040
and your data set is a nice thing

1089
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,359
to uh to do that because it's very rare

1090
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,480
that

1091
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,599
you have so at let's several types of

1092
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,400
material in the same location

1093
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,640
maybe you do it in the future yeah that

1094
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,400
would be also interesting to see

1095
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,480
how reliable are for example the

1096
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,720
determination from potter or from kings

1097
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,319
yeah that's that that was my point

1098
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,359
actually yeah

1099
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:53,040
that's a nice idea yeah great thank you

1100
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,040
thank you good talk yeah

1101
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,319
okay thank you uh is anybody else have

1102
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,560
questions

1103
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,480
if so i guess i have one quick sort of

1104
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,119
follow on just from from andre's comment

1105
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,400
i mean

1106
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,040
um what consideration have you given to

1107
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,599
the corrections or lack of corrections

1108
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,560
for

1109
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,440
you know cooling rates and isotropy and

1110
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,200
these kind of things

1111
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,359
especially cooling rate because it's a

1112
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,119
really tricky one to

1113
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,480
you know pin down how much of a

1114
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,400
correction should be

1115
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,599
uh should be applied and i guess that's

1116
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,040
kind of probably what

1117
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,720
one andre is kind of getting out by

1118
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,480
looking at the different materials as

1119
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,240
well

1120
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,160
yeah that would be important to have

1121
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,520
both an isotropic correction and cool

1122
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,920
grade correction

1123
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,760
i have to say that the most of the

1124
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,880
recent data both corrections

1125
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,839
are are included so that's a quite good

1126
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,160
thing

1127
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,000
also in some older data these

1128
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,520
corrections have been

1129
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,160
somehow it or take any consideration

1130
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,240
then the biggest problem is with the

1131
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,520
oldest data that in most cases

1132
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,040
miss both anisotropy and cool grade

1133
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,839
and mainly when we refer to data from

1134
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,800
pottery or even well-shaped bricks or

1135
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,200
tiles

1136
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,640
then then isotropic correction could be

1137
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,760
also very important

1138
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,400
very important so definitely there is a

1139
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,960
lot of

1140
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,760
work to do as far as density studies in

1141
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,960
italy is

1142
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,319
are concerned we have very few data

1143
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,640
and um sometimes not

1144
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,920
the best one so they will have to get

1145
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,880
concentrated

1146
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:40,000
and do much more job on that

1147
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,000
it's time consuming

1148
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,680
the low success rate rate that can

1149
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,079
be some disadvantages but we'll have to

1150
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,079
do it

1151
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,160
thank you we feel you the one we're

1152
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,280
working with the

1153
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,440
intensity intensity

1154
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:06,160
yeah we know what you've been through

1155
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,160
okay so anybody else has questions

1156
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:16,000
for now we don't um

1157
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:20,079
i i may have questions but we can

1158
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,079
i want to leave a room for others

1159
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,480
okay then um so the

1160
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,160
uh it's interesting how we all struggle

1161
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,359
with selection criteria

1162
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,760
and they still remain really

1163
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,079
subjective um of course as you said

1164
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,119
the most strict criteria we use the last

1165
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,800
day that we have

1166
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,000
that's kind of a given it's expected

1167
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:51,440
um but the in while selecting

1168
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,839
um the this previous studies

1169
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,240
i was wondering if you can use kind of

1170
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:00,720
several sets of criteria and they weight

1171
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:04,000
them in a way that you consider all the

1172
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,960
data you have rather than just get rid

1173
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,920
of them

1174
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,040
in a way cut them off kind of give them

1175
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,200
a weight

1176
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:15,680
rather than just have you have you

1177
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,079
thought of it have you done something

1178
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,119
that's something that very often uh

1179
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,480
we observe in the publications and many

1180
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,280
people apply this

1181
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,400
way thing on the data and that's a good

1182
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,040
idea we have

1183
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,359
not done it there also because um we

1184
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,599
what it just to be sure that we have

1185
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,800
the best data as far as as it is

1186
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,880
possible

1187
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,839
of course keeping more data even if they

1188
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,000
are waiting

1189
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:45,680
less could be good to have a much richer

1190
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,400
uh more data available but um

1191
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,280
we decided here that we should work on

1192
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,119
the best

1193
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,800
data possible according to this

1194
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,839
selection retail of course if we were

1195
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,839
more strict

1196
00:46:53,839 --> 00:47:00,240
it will be even the best data but

1197
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,319
the number would be very few very very

1198
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,720
small what is interesting however with

1199
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,319
selection criteria is the

1200
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,800
the the errors on in dating that usually

1201
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,760
we use a cut off

1202
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,040
a cut-off criterium based on the

1203
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,400
interval of dating

1204
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,440
like one two hundred to er one hundred

1205
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,040
two hundred years

1206
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,359
but then it's difficult to to understand

1207
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,800
how reliable is this dating

1208
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:31,760
so many data that are not so

1209
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,720
well dated past this standard selection

1210
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,280
criteria

1211
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,400
and we use them for modeling of global

1212
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,520
data sets that's

1213
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,079
i think it's important problem as far as

1214
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,200
magnetic data are concerned and it's a

1215
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,559
problem that cannot be

1216
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:50,480
easily solved because we don't have

1217
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:55,599
direct control on the dating or in the

1218
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,599
on the updating of dating as time passes

1219
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,079
okay thank you and i was wondering also

1220
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,119
about

1221
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:06,079
how you dealt with the problem of the

1222
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:10,640
different methods that have been used

1223
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:12,800
uh beyond the teletalia

1224
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,119
methods i don't know how you treat them

1225
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,240
and weight them or did you consider them

1226
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,599
all as

1227
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,880
no actually uh we were from this point

1228
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,200
of view were quite

1229
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,800
lucky let's say that most of the of the

1230
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,520
data from uh

1231
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,480
italy nearby the countries come from the

1232
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,520
old reacts method or multi-specimen

1233
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,160
what we we did and we try to pay

1234
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,720
attention

1235
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,000
of if we are dealing with the method to

1236
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,680
be sure that

1237
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,040
an isotropic correction or some other

1238
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,480
corrections have been taken into

1239
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,839
consideration

1240
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,480
and more or less we try to individually

1241
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,040
evaluate the reliability of data we

1242
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,720
haven't

1243
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:55,440
used such a cut off

1244
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,440
criteria

1245
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,839
okay thank you so anybody else has

1246
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,599
questions

1247
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:06,880
otherwise we can switch to

1248
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:09,920
uh the informal part of the talks

1249
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,160
oh yoga's as questions yes yeah

1250
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,000
sorry i have a question uh with respect

1251
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,200
to the quality of the

1252
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
data from this neolithic kiln which

1253
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,440
was used for baking bread and with the

1254
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,640
quality of the

1255
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,200
other kiln which is used to to make

1256
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,119
bricks so with respect to the

1257
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,520
temperatures because

1258
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,880
to bake bread you you don't need such a

1259
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,559
high temperature

1260
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,240
is there any difference in the in the

1261
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,359
quality

1262
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,880
well there has been a study about the

1263
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,680
heating temperatures of this

1264
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,440
of these structures in fact uh we are

1265
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,160
not talking about very high temperatures

1266
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,880
it was

1267
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,640
if i remember well around 5 400

1268
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,160
450 degrees but

1269
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,040
we still it was heated enough to give us

1270
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,079
a i think

1271
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,800
nice directional results but

1272
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,920
definitely the data from the the kin and

1273
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,280
the temperatures

1274
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,079
arrived in the gill where um

1275
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,319
much higher uh we're talking about

1276
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,200
temperatures higher than 600

1277
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,480
degrees and the magnetization was much

1278
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,599
stronger

1279
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,920
much stronger in this case

1280
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:26,960
but once again we have nice nice

1281
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,400
nice directional results nice

1282
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,400
mean value well constrained

1283
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:42,400
okay thank you so maybe greg

1284
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,400
you can rub up now

1285
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,880
yeah there we go um so now thank you

1286
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,319
everyone for for coming in thank you

1287
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,280
uh for a fantastic talk uh today i

1288
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,319
want to take this chance to thank um all

1289
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,599
of our speakers

1290
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:01,520
um for for 2020 uh i've actually i've

1291
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,040
lost count how many we've had i think

1292
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:08,400
this is the ninth or tenth um but if

1293
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,440
if you want to uh catch up on any of the

1294

in this presentation or any of the other

1309
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,080
presentations uh it is a citable object

1310
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,359
uh and and you can give

the kia and all of our presenters credit

1313
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,760
for their uh excellent and hard work

1314
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,800
um just a bit of a heads up for

1315
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,160
the schedule uh uh into next year so in

1316
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,119
december we're going to have

1317
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,040
a break um because agu will be taking up

1318
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,240
most of december with

1319
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:08,000
their fall meeting um we will come back

1320
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:11,520
in in 2021 now here in the uk

1321
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,040
at the very beginning um of uh january

1322
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,760
we will typically host

1323
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,520
uh our uk magnetic interactions our

1324
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,160
local domestic meeting

1325
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,559
um this year because of of lockdown we

1326
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,720
can't

1327
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,480
hold that meeting in person so we will

1328
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,800
be holding a virtual

1329
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,640
uh version of this and we're going to be

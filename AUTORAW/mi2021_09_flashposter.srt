1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
yes um yeah so uh i

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,879
looked at a lot of samples in the

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,519
devonian and the devonian has always

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,080
been a very problematic time for

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,200
paleomagnetism

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
um and so this has affected basically

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,520
everything in the devonian

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,359
the time scales so the polarity pattern

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
is not very well known

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,439
there's bits that are gray and but also

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
paleo poles have been affected and

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,560
there's

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
um well the amount of paint intensities

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,359
is increasing

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
um and so we wanted to basically uh have

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,440
a look

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,079
at the uh the polarity patterns so we

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
selected

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,600
three sections in germany canada

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,520
uh and poland and we tried to do

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,480
magnetosphere on them

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,640
they showed little evidence for

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,760
remineralization

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,399
or significant heating so the chances of

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,480
primary directions in these sections

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,440
were very good

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,840
but we showed that basically there's

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,520
still a lot of trouble

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,840
all the samples are very weak they

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,720
so that excludes the possibility of a

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,799
lot of

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,840
rock magnetic techniques so we were

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,799
basically limited to copper bridge runs

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,159
um

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,479
and even though the samples

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,280
were likely not overprinted because they

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,680
had no overprint conditions met

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
we do see big overprints so we see

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,600
everywhere

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,840
present-day field overprint and also a

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,079
caiman direction so that is the burmo

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,799
carbonyl first reverse supercron

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,840
and then we basically see three types of

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,439
behavior

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,600
um so for the section from germany

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
we see something that might be a

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,439
devonian primary direction but we only

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,320
have

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,920
one polarity and we don't have any field

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,040
test because the section is

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,200
flat lying for the section in poland we

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
see both polarities

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
and for the section in canada we

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,880
basically see random directions

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,840
and then we looked at all the other

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
devonian data so we looked at the

57
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,920
magnetostratigraphy

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,599
so this is part of the pattern in the

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,879
frennie and fermenian

60
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,160
which is based on random data um we had

61
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,480
a look at

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,599
a lot of paleo pool paper so i looked at

63
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,040
more than 80 papers

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,400
and what we see is basically that the

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,440
field in the devonian

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,440
looks very strange uh there is

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,599
basically no good convincing data

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,959
um and we also see very weak paleo

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,760
intensities so

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,680
we are now thinking that perhaps uh the

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,319
field was very weak and in a very poor

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
shape

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,360
and we're asking the question whether uh

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,760
there is a link to all these biotic

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
crises in the devonian

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
and we're making a call out to everyone

77
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,519
to publish the veronium data because i

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,959
think that there might be a lot more

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
there might be a lot more attempts that

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,040
people did but they haven't managed to

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,680
publish it because the data was just so

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,720
weird

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,800
or of poor quality

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,400
so yeah please publish your data because

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,360
that's the only way that we can

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,480
understand the field in the devonian and

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,640
i'll be happy to

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,640
discuss this at some other points with

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,120
anyone

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,920
thank you very much who

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,920
is is anyone else wanting to present

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,120
i could hop on if no one wants to go

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,360
uh i think hannah just oh yeah

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,440
no hannah you go yeah you know you spoke

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,959
up

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,120
you sure okay um let me just get

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:56,400
my okay you should be able to see

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,040
a poster is that right yeah we can

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,439
i can't see what you're seeing so um

100
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
yeah

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,640
hello i'm hannah and my poster is on the

102
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,560
application of spherical sloping

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,040
functions to the inversion of virtual

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,799
observatory satellite magnetic data

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
into localized regions of flow on the

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
core mantle boundary

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,199
so our research is motivated by

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
improving the international geomagnetic

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
reference field model

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,759
the idrf is updated every five years but

111
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,800
due to our poor understanding of how the

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,800
core flow is

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,040
changing the 2015 to forecast error was

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,440
much larger than we expected

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,600
we want to improve forecasts of magnetic

116
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
field change by better understanding

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
individual regions of flow on the core

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
mantle boundary

119
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
study of these regions are motivated by

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,280
four main points

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
the assumptions required when inverting

122
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,199
from field to flow which define the flow

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,479
uniquely over part

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,720
only part of the corsair core surface

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,479
such as the tangentially geostrophic

126
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,520
flow model

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,600
flow assumption number two uh

128
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
we want to investigate different fluid

129
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,479
motions in different regions of the core

130
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
such as

131
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,400
the column above and below the inner

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
core

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,000
three there's sometimes spatially uneven

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,639
data collection

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,840
and four investigating how features on

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,639
the base of the mantle

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
affects flow and the core mantles on the

138
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,919
outer core surface

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,360
so from seismic anomalies and thermal

140
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,440
anomalies

141
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,639
so i've been working with kathy whaler

142
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,720
and kieran beggan

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
to apply a mathematical technique called

144
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
slapping functions

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,479
to core flows on the core mantle

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,400
boundary the slap-in functions have

147
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,880
previously been used extensively in

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,120
geodesy gravity and crustal magnetic

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,160
field models as the functions allow a

150
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,000
spatio-spectral trade-off

151
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,080
in order to constrain spherical

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,520
harmonics within a region of interest

153
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,800
on the sphere my poster is focused on

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,720
the impact of

155
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
these large low shear velocity

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,000
preferences

157
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,520
um on the base of the mantle which are a

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,919
seismic anomaly

159
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,759
and also kind of trying to demonstrate

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,280
the current limitations that we have

161
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,560
when uh using the spherical slapping

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,840
functions

163
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,479
um we've been incorporating slap in

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,120
functions

165
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,440
into our inversions of virtual

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
observatory magnetic data sets

167
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
so that we can directly invert into a

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
region

169
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,440
as opposed to constraining the flow

170
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,520
after an inversion has taken place

171
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,360
our flow models when using slapping

172
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,280
functions show an improvement

173
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,280
in the presentation in the preservation

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,400
of small features

175
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,080
and we've reduced the speeds outside of

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,720
the

177
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,440
lsvp patches kind of like here

178
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,759
um but there's still quite a lot of um

179
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,560
flow outside these regions

180
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,280
um moving forward we've got quite a lot

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
of

182
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
plans so we want to keep investigating

183
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,639
different regions

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,520
and remove upward continuation as part

185
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,880
of

186
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,759
our inversions and maybe use altitude

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,800
cognizance slap in functions instead

188
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,400
which would allow our

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,960
functions to be dependent on the

190
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,120
downward continuation and not a step

191
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,479
that we have to kind of work around

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,319
but i can explain that more in person um

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,639
so thanks a lot feel free to come and

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,400
talk to me about slap in functions

195
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,199
the impact of lsvps on core flow

196
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,880
uh inversions virtual observatories or

197
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,319
just to say hi

198
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,000
thanks thank you

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,240
well you know what i you know just come

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,400
by see my poster i can i can just talk

201
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,479
about it real quickly uh

202
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
well at liverpool we've been working on

203
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,240
updating the

204
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
paleo intensity pint database a real big

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,039
push

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,160
and in particular um trying to add the

207
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,240
the qpi

208
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
aspect and try to fill in as much as we

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,960
can of the pint data set

210
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,120
and so this is a bit of a teaser of that

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
but

212
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,280
yeah we can yep so um

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,879
so my poster is on the paleo intensity

214
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
results um

215
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
i've gotten as part of a collaboration

216
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,560
between

217
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,400
liverpool and curtin university um from

218
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,039
the 2.6 billion year old rocks

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
uh from the yilgaan craton um they've

220
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,680
previously been

221
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,639
looked up for directions can i get rid

222
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,199
of you

223
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,919
um by one of the phd students over there

224
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,280
and they

225
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,919
showed that despite the fact that

226
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,120
there's been several generations of dyke

227
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,279
swarms in the area

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
you do actually appear to have the chrm

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,919
component at quite high temperatures

230
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,200
from about like

231
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,680
530 to 565 degrees

232
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
and the magnetic mineralogy of the

233
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,880
samples looks really good

234
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,000
um capper bridge and vfdb thermomag

235
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,839
for a lot of the samples i've been

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
looking at they show you know really

237
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
clearly

238
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,240
magnetic curie temperatures um

239
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
very fine grains because of the

240
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,959
exhalation

241
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,480
of the magnetite and ilmanite yeah

242
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,839
pretty fine grain based on the

243
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,839
day plot um so i

244
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,040
did paleo intensity on what i could both

245
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
thermal uh a microwave teleo type as

246
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,120
well as

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,360
shore method and i did do ltd

248
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,600
shaw and thermal tele-a

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,640
with the easy protocol but none of the

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
ltd stuff

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,399
passed it seemed to give really terrible

252
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519
pass rates and none of it could really

253
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,519
be accepted

254
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,120
um but you've got some nice generally i

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,920
mean two-slope but

256
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
very clearly linked to the overprint in

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,800
most cases

258
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,080
and also um the chrm intensity still

259
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
represents a decent amount of the

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,200
overall intensity of the samples

261
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,240
and yeah um only five sites um

262
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,080
we were able to get passable

263
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,120
measurements but that's still quite

264
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,640
reasonable

265
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,519
um so i know richard earlier was asking

266
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,800
about

267
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,880
um the icn pattern and

268
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,720
uh what it should look like and

269
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,920
um well the oh bear of a tell

270
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,800
2009 the thing that we kind of all talk

271
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,600
about with

272
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,680
um the weakening field leading up to icy

273
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,480
at inner core nucleation

274
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,480
at either sometime between like 1.5 to

275
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,959
1.3 billion years or

276
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,279
1.1 billion years or even 500 ma um

277
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,800
if you're expecting really quite strong

278
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,240
paleo intensity measurements

279
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,480
um sort of around 2.6 ga based on this

280
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
they are definitely sort of quite low

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
compared to what you'd expect

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
and also um quite low compared to the

283
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
wiki mother dykes

284
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,440
the sort of closest in time and location

285
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,519
around 2.4

286
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,360
billion years um but yes so

287
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,640
there has been more recent research

288
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
which suggests that actually we wouldn't

289
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
see

290
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
um a spike in a core nucleation orlando

291
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
hotel

292
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,040
2017 paper um so i guess with the low

293
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,360
results you could argue

294
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,800
well you need a lot better coverage of

295
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,240
the precambrian

296
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,000
but maybe we are seeing more variation

297
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,519
and the 2000 and the

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
weakening field trend is just an

299
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
underlying trend that we're also seeing

300
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
variation on top of

301
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,160
or maybe we're just kind of putting on a

302
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,040
trend i don't know

303
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,240
um but yeah you can come see my poster i

304
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,560
think i've just explained all of it

305
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,560
sorry

306
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,480
and how do i stop the screen share

307
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,040
thank you very much louise uh dan

308
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,040
you want to go

309
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,519
um let me see

310
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
if that works

311
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,880
can you see my pdf yeah we can

312
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,760
okay that worked so this is my yearly

313
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
project update

314
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,959
that i do every year at magnetic

315
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,920
interactions i

316
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,360
am looking at paleo intensities in the

317
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,399
edo current period

318
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,440
because in in this period we had some

319
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,880
anomalous directional results and it's

320
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,920
also quite interesting because

321
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,680
because it should be around the area of

322
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,120
it could be around the area of inner

323
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,279
corner creation

324
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,440
so what we did is we did a multi method

325
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,399
in density study well more of them

326
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,880
actually and but now we have about

327
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,560
even over a thousand intensity specimens

328
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,800
that have been measured

329
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
with over half of them come from

330
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,320
microwave

331
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
and and thermal italian methods and the

332
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
rest

333
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,560
is double heating showers to italia or

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,440
from wozen experiments

335
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,639
we have success rates that different

336
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,639
depending on on

337
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,480
site and method between zero and

338
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,880
25 and the ones that do pass

339
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,160
pretty much all look look the same we

340
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
get our two slope

341
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,800
behavior and have to be quite careful to

342
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
differentiate between

343
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079
too slow behavior and sucking arrived

344
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,399
plots but it is

345
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,839
quite helpful that we do get directional

346
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,240
changes

347
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,279
at the same point where there's a bend

348
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,800
between

349
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,519
between the two slopes and

350
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,480
basically look the same for for thermal

351
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,000
telly

352
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,040
and microwave telly and the results

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,240
here the ones that i'm showing are all

354
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,560
lower than than two micro teslas and

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,839
microwave and thermal results do agree

356
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,959
pretty well there

357
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,440
if we look at at shaw we can't really

358
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,199
see a

359
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,120
two slope behavior well you can if you

360
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,880
use your imagination and the same for

361
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,760
pseudo delia

362
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,639
but if we compare what we get from from

363
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,279
the three

364
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,760
methods then then they all agree pretty

365
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,440
well

366
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,639
and usually the lowest results come from

367
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,240
from the pseudo-italian method so if we

368
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,959
look at

369
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,079
the vdms at this time period we can see

370
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,440
that all of them are

371
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,000
really really low we have an in orange

372
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,519
here

373
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,519
rigid bonus uh single crystal result

374
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,720
and pretty much all of what we've been

375
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,079
measuring between

376
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,000
600 and 560 ma has been

377
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,160
has been agreeing pretty well with with

378
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,279
that and it basically looks like it's

379
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,639
it's getting even

380
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,920
weaker as it gets older and we get

381
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,839
a bit of different results around 550

382
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,440
so we get higher brilliant densities

383
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,120
here and if we say higher

384
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,240
i'm talking about like 10 micro tesla so

385
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,959
for context the present day field

386
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,079
strength

387
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,079
in this plot would be up here somewhere

388
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,440
and if you look at all of the

389
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,639
intensities the low

390
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,240
and the high ones and compare those two

391
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,079
to younger distributions of dipole

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,240
moments then we can see they are

393
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,600
really different from anything we can

394
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,040
see after that

395
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,639
even the hyperactivity periods

396
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,519
do not even close give us intensities

397
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,360
that

398
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,800
that low as we see and in the idiocarin

399
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,760
so what we also did is is look at

400
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,959
directional circular variation and when

401
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
we started to do that

402
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,480
it really gave us results that looked

403
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,639
pretty similar

404
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,519
to what we would get from from psv10

405
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,519
apart from the

406
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,000
from the error bars that we see but i've

407
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,279
done a bit more on

408
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,519
that by now and have been a i've been

409
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,440
getting a bit stricter with my criteria

410
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,279
of what to use and what not to use

411
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,880
and i don't have a final result yet but

412
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,920
it looks like

413
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,519
it will give us a model a that is a bit

414
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,800
higher than what we see here

415
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,839
and a b value that is quite a bit lower

416
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,680
than what we got here and

417
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,440
yeah at this point i can give you the

418
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,399
the same conclusion that i've been

419
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,199
giving you

420
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,399
every year namely that the the field was

421
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,759
pretty weird back then

422
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,920
and also very weak but

423
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,440
now we can also say that it looks like

424
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,639
it has been weak over an

425
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,240
extended period of time maybe 40 million

426
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,480
years and maybe even longer

427
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,920
it doesn't and that it seems to change

428
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,880
at the

429
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,440
ethio karen cambrian transition and it

430
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
seems to

431
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
get stronger there and i think that's

432
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,079
pretty much

433
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,880
all i can say here just come by and

434
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,279
then we can have a chat about details

435
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,279
thank you

436
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,480
thank you very much uh is there another

437
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,839
one

438
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,839
becky let's just put us up please

439
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,759
so i'm now going to take you guys all

440
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,279
the way to antarctica

441
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,319
welcome to the amundsen sea uh so here

442
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,439
is an area of interest more recently and

443
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,160
you may have heard about this in the

444
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,640
news

445
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,640
about weights glacier and its concern

446
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,640
for sort of rise and sea levels and so

447
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,360
this was an iodp expedition that took

448
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
place in

449
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,199
january 2019 and i did not say on this

450
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,360
cruise i'll be

451
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,039
up front and but i'm working on you

452
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,919
channels that were collected from

453
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,200
site u1533 which is shown here in the

454
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,200
star

455
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,640
um and so we have fif i've been working

456
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,360
on the pleistocene section

457
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,280
from this cruise to sort of work out

458
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,679
what's been happening recently

459
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,320
and so my main aims are sort of to

460
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,880
refine

461
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,000
the magnesium stratigraphic framework

462
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,039
that was sort of collected

463
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,360
on the ship and try and produce an rpi

464
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,120
record because as we sort of

465
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
look in the southern ocean there aren't

466
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,840
very many paleo intensity records from

467
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,000
new channels and sediment cores

468
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,280
that sort of exist and if they do exist

469
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
they're quite short

470
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,160
and so trying to work out whether this

471
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,080
is possible here it's like you

472
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,640
1533 and then to look at

473
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
the environmental magnetism of this site

474
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,120
and

475
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,039
all this together should be able to tell

476
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,480
us sort of a bit more about what was the

477
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,200
paleo climate like

478
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,440
at fight us 1533 sort of during the

479
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,720
pleistocene

480
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,760
so my results so far are pretty good

481
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,799
and we've refined the magnetographic

482
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,360
framework

483
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,320
and we have all the major polarity

484
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,919
reversals

485
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,919
so for the last two and a half million

486
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,760
years and and

487
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,000
on my poster you'll see sort of that

488
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,520
there's uh highlighted

489
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,120
excursions that have been picked

490
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,600
depicted from a

491
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,559
deconvolution of the record that i've

492
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,160
got

493
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,200
and i've also got a really good sort of

494
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
start

495
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,720
to the relative paleo intensity record

496
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,240
so this is sort of highlighted here in

497
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,799
this figure and

498
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,799
so this is my paleo intensity and it

499
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,520
shows really good correlation

500
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,720
to the piso 1500 stack which is a

501
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,679
reference stack

502
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,679
that sort of is sort of from 12 chords

503
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,559
from across the world that's correlated

504
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,760
to

505
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,320
and the oxygen 18 record so this is this

506
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,120
dark

507
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,160
green line on this graph yeah but

508
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,440
unfortunately

509
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,200
so it's only 1.5 million years long

510
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
and my record extends further than that

511
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,520
so this

512
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,320
stack here is an equatorial pacific

513
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,720
stack

514
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,600
which as you can see from my gray bars

515
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,960
which correlate

516
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,799
down to the paleo intensity they sort of

517
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,720
vanish after this point

518
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,720
and this could be either because the

519
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,640
pacific stack that i've chosen to use

520
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,799
isn't a good one so i need to find a

521
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,880
better stack to compare to

522
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,360
and or it could be some change in

523
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,720
behavior sort of later on here

524
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,840
so these orange bars are major polarity

525
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,880
reversals that

526
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,600
are shown better on the full poster

527
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,600
and so here is the bruins cron this is

528
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,240
the gauss matiama boundary

529
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,039
and so there may be some sort of change

530
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,640
here

531
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
and i should point out this gap in the

532
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
record is a u channel that was not

533
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,360
sampled

534
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,840
with the rest of the new channels and

535
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,240
but we will should receive that later on

536
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,159
uh sort of to fill in that gap and work

537
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
out what's happening in that space as

538
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,320
well

539
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
and so beyond that for future work uh

540
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,559
i'm gonna

541
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,240
validate those excursions that i

542
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,760
mentioned to sort of work out

543
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,480
whether they're true whether they're to

544
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,600
do with changes in magnetic grain size

545
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,159
or mineralogy

546
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,679
and sort of deeper look into the core

547
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,799
descriptions to see whether there's a

548
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,760
physical

549
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,720
visible reason for those excursions and

550
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
and then if they are

551
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,960
true excursions there are quite a lot of

552
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,880
them in the bruins crown which can help

553
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,679
tie down the age model better

554
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,480
for the younger section of this record

555
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
and then i'm going to

556
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
plan to do sort of rock rock magnetic

557
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,520
experiments too to sort of

558
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,240
fill it off fill up sort of the rest of

559
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
the

560
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,679
information to work out what is

561
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,120
recording everything

562
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,520
and then see sort of how does that

563
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,960
change environmentally in the anderson

564
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,960
sea

565
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,919
yeah come to my poster and hopefully i

566
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,919
will do better there

567
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,320
thank you very much i think there's one

568
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,960
more

569
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,960
from ben

570
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,480
yeah i'm just trying to show you

571
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
okay

572
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,919
cool yeah so in this we've been looking

573
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,799
at um

574
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,880
paleocircular variation off to the pcrs

575
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,440
and so compile the triassic

576
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,120
direction bgp database and incorporate

577
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,320
this into a longer time interval which

578
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,960
we're calling the pctrx and

579
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,320
most other things um we found behavior

580
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
in this time to be

581
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,600
very similar to that observed in the pre

582
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,520
cns which includes drastic high

583
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,480
productivity

584
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,240
so there's a bit of background uh psb is

585
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,760
commonly studied as vgp scatter

586
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,080
and this relationship's often expressed

587
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,480
formal g which is defined by

588
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,120
coefficients a and b which given it in

589
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,320
this

590
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,480
equation um on several studies

591
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,760
of um listening to intervals since the

592
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,520
beginning of the pcrs

593
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,120
however most of the trials is not

594
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,280
included in the east

595
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,919
and so these studies looking at normally

596
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,919
a relationship between psp behavior and

597
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,080
average reversal frequency

598
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,679
whether quantifying psv with va ratio

599
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,960
from model g

600
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,880
um however like the nature of this

601
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,240
relationship is still unclear and so

602
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
this study is looking at what maybe

603
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,600
traffic psp behavior may be able to

604
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,919
tell us about this relationship and also

605
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,320
making use of a new idea that model ga

606
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,840
promiser may be able to provide

607
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,240
information regarding morphology of the

608
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,559
geomagnetic field

609
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,720
so as well as compiling pulse pcrs

610
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,679
database or compiled the new pcrs

611
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,760
database

612
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,840
just to allow for a direct comparison as

613
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,520
now uh both intervals will satisfy the

614
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,919
same selection criteria

615
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,679
we estimated a vgp scatter and the model

616
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,360
g coefficients for each time interval

617
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,840
and look to how the data selected

618
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,480
influence the observed dispersions so we

619
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,880
investigate

620
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,640
effects of serial correlation and

621
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,000
excluding direct data derived from great

622
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,559
circles

623
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and on top of this we use some

624
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,000
additional selection criteria

625
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
to generate higher quality database and

626
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,120
then check the robustness of the

627
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,960
dispersions that we see

628
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,159
and finally our results were compared

629
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,039
with those from other published data

630
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,320
compilations

631
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:37,760
representing intervals since the pcrs

632
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,440
and so uh in the results what we see

633
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,840
is a little evidence of a relationship

634
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,159
between vgp scatter and light choose

635
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,919
given in figure one and then yeah in

636
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,640
figure two we can see that the the pcrs

637
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,159
showed a strong

638
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,400
increase in scatter with latitude we've

639
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,200
got agreement with the model g fit

640
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,720
and incorporating the things like serial

641
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,760
correlation and great circle data had

642
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,960
little effect

643
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,120
so they weren't really taken into

644
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,240
consideration in the end and then

645
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,679
um yeah this was also true when using

646
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,360
the higher quality data so the overall

647
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,520
dispersion was pretty much the same

648
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,000
suggesting the dispersions to be robust

649
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,840
features of each time interval

650
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,159
and then when compared with other time

651
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,240
intervals since the pulse pcrs

652
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,360
we see the vgp dispersions very similar

653
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,000
to that observed

654
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,919
in the pre-cns this is demonstrated by

655
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,799
the the similarity in the model g shape

656
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,840
parameters

657
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,080
and in figure 3 you can see the nearly

658
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,600
identical ba ratios

659
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,200
and this type of behavior this

660
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,400
latitudinal invariance is traditionally

661
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,760
thought to represent times of high

662
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,279
reversal frequency

663
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,520
such as the drastic hyperactivity and

664
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,640
the pre-cns but here we see there's very

665
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,919
consistent behavior

666
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,600
at the time interval between the two

667
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,799
super crowns despite quite a large

668
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,880
variation

669
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,400
in a point reversal frequency so part

670
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,760
suggesting that uh

671
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,000
any relationship between the vessel

672
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,120
frequency and psp more complex

673
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,960
um maybe future studies should uh treat

674
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,520
this as one time interval

675
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,720
and then also like in the the recent

676
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
paper from bigger than others at the

677
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,840
back end last year where

678
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,919
we find share promises don't do not

679
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,360
necessarily call vary and so as a result

680
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,960
maybe the traditional interpretation

681
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,120
appears to be outdated

682
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,440
so from this study as long as possible

683
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,200
the super crowns occur when a is lower

684
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
and so actual dipole dominance is

685
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
greater

686
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
which is the field morphology was talked

687
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,240
about earlier and um

688
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,600
however the cns is only slightly but not

689
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,360
statistically distinct from time of

690
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,240
reversals which from this would make it

691
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,799
difficult to

692
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,320
to say for certain and then if you were

693
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,279
to look for like a new meaning behind

694
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,960
model g

695
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,799
b parameter perhaps then that could be

696
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,679
related to field intensity or average

697
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,840
vdm

698
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,000
where you see the lower values um in

699
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,679
between the two super crons could maybe

700
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,919
roughly agree with an extended metastory

701
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,400
dipole however we need a lot more paleo

702
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,159
intensity data to look into that

703
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,240
and then finally it would seem that the

704
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
pcrs is a unique time interval

705
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,159
um or at least the last 300 million

706
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,720
years or so regarding psp behavior

707
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,159
uh estimates of the model g promoters

708
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,400
are very different and statistically

709
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,159
distinct from terms of reversals

710
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,000
and using the polar associated with

711
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,480
model g a promo

712
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,600
was just a time of like unique um axial

713
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,200
dipole dominance

714
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,039
so maybe this could be responsible for

715
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
its extended duration compared to the

716
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,400
cns or

717
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,679
maybe an artifact for the long length of

718
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
the super chrome

719
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,919
so yeah if anyone's interested come and

720
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,919
find me

1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,720
so ali will just be kind of putting an

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,359
economic twist on

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,599
some magnetic work and so he's using

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
statistical machine learning to classify

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,040
hydrothermal alteration

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,400
so when you're ready can you see that

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,119
yeah yeah okay so thank you vince

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,160
yeah as vince said i'm olly and i'm a

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
second year

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,160
uh in my second year of my phd which

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,920
focuses on the structural controls of

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,760
paw free copper deposits

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
and today i'm going to be presenting a

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,280
machine learning a new machine

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,040
learning algorithm that i've developed

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,440
mainly with nasa mendini in

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,640
nazapa nazarbayev university in

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,680
kazakhstan

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
and this will form my first chapter and

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,039
hopefully we'll be getting to admit it

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,239
in the next few months

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,399
um so disclaimer there's

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,760
not a lot of magnetic measurements in

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,120
the first section of this

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,680
but i will i will get there um

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,039
so first a little background with the

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
continued growth in the global

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,680
population

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
expected to continue for the next

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
century

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,640
and our increased appetite for the

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,760
latest and greatest technological

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
advancements

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
the continued urbanization in both the

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,760
developed and undeveloped

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
underdeveloped nations and are

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
increasing awareness

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,520
and move towards renewable energy

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,759
sources which all require

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,439
between 20 and 30 times more copper than

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,840
conventional energy sources

42
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,439
the society's demand for copper is

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
actually predicted to increase

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,840
by greater than 300 percent over the

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,600
next 50 years

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
and this just highlights the importance

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
for geologists to develop

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,079
uh new methods for discovering deeply

49
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,520
buried deposits

50
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,159
and change the way uh the type of

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,799
uh the type and way that data is

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
collected

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
and used to increase mining efficiency

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,200
in the future

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
so for those of you that don't really

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
know

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,119
the majority of the world's copper

58
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,640
populate copper

59
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,840
comes and other metals come from

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,439
uh pulvery copper deposits and

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,000
they and the very widely accepted

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,039
current model for formation is one where

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
you have

64
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,400
these large bodies of igneous material

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,599
that evolve

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,400
over time and in some

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,280
uh at the later stages of that

68
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,120
evolvement

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,879
you have the breakthrough of fluids

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,280
through the roof of the uh

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
through the roof of these intrusions to

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,200
form these multi-phase

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
portfolio copper stock works and where

74
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
this occur

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,840
where this occurs there are three main

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
triggers for mineralization

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
the first being the cooling and

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
expansion

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,280
of vapor caused by steep temperature

80
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
caused by the steep temperature gradient

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
at the top of these fingers

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
and that's due to sulfide solubility

83
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
being

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,040
temperature and density dependent the

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
second

86
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,360
being the evolution of a fracture

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,519
network above the deposit

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,360
which causes rapid pressure drops as

89
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,319
hydro fracturing occurs

90
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,000
and the third being the neutralization

91
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,920
of the hydrothermal fluid

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
as it interacts with circulating

93
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,080
groundwater

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,800
so as with all mineral deposits

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,080
this fluid flow causes alteration in the

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,400
surrounding whole

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,040
rocks and the current very widely

98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,400
accepted alteration pattern that occurs

99
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,920
is this one by soso which was published

100
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
in 2010

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,440
however both within industry and

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,720
academia

103
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,920
these alteration zones play a vital role

104
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,560
in both the exploration

105
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,560
and extraction of the metals but

106
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,239
as until now this is based

107
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
entirely on a geologist's eye which as

108
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,319
you can imagine

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,879
inherently causes ambiguity because we

110
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,959
all see

111
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
and interpret things completely

112
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,360
differently

113
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,400
um uh so

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,599
the solution that i think well i what i

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
think the solution to this

116
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,239
is is being able to cross-reference

117
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,200
quantitative data sets um

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
which in this case i'm using a magnetic

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
susceptibility

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
but would like to bring in more magnetic

121
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,439
data into that

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,439
and hyperspectral data

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,079
so due to this being based on

124
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,440
quantitative data then this would be

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,600
completely repeatable

126
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,759
and reproducible and unfortunate

127
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,400
ultimately actually means that anyone

128
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,440
can collect the large quantities of data

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,160
that would make

130
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
the outcome more accurate and also give

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
you a better picture of these

132
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,440
large multi-billion pound mines that i'm

133
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,400
working on um so currently

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,320
i have only integrated ip and op

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,919
magnetic acceptability into the

136
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,400
algorithm that i'll describe in a bit um

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,080
but as i will demonstrate later there

138
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
are significant differences between

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
the groupings that the algorithm

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
identifies

141
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,720
that represent more than just maxis data

142
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,560
and i'm so i'm

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
and i'm totally wanting to incorporate

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
more characterization

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
characterization mag data but currently

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,560
don't have the data

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,160
uh quality quantity uh

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,199
for the method that i'm using here

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
um so for the complete this is this

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,440
presentation

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
uh maxus is defined as the ability of a

152
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
material

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,919
to be magnetized in a low ac field but

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,919
i'm

155
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
not going to dwell on that at all and

156
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,360
move on quite quickly so

157
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,160
for those of you that don't know uh also

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,919
hyperspec

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
i'm going to also use hyperspectral

160
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
reflectance which is

161
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
a non-destructive technique which

162
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
collects and processes

163
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,720
information from across the

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,000
electromagnetic spectrum

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,800
and that reflectance when normalized to

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,639
a whole

167
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,440
envelope looks something like this

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,080
and this is the spectra of asymmetrical

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,680
clay

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,000
known as alunite if i then

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,919
present those for both monterey

172
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,080
montamarillonite and kaolinite

173
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,039
as well and you can begin to see

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,280
variations

175
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,080
in the absorption pattern within the

176
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,080
same mineral

177
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,199
group in this case smectite

178
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,360
from these we can extract that from

179
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
these we can extract various pieces of

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,280
information

181
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
by using different algorithms which look

182
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
at

183
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
four different things and at different

184
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
parts of the spectrum

185
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,560
so the sort of things that you can get

186
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,120
quantitative numbers for

187
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,919
is for example the composition which is

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
based off

189
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,080
the peak position which for example in

190
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
this

191
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,000
uh example you can see the

192
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:59,440
alienate having a peak at 2115

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,759
the um montmorillonite having a peak

194
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,240
between 2000 and twenty

195
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,599
two thousand and twenty two at two

196
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
thousand two hundred and five

197
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,000
and two thousand two hundred and fifteen

198
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
and then also kayla and i having the

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,560
same peak

200
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,639
uh at a peak of around 2020

201
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,759
2206 as

202
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,400
and if we then look at those um

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,039
peaks we can look at the intensity of

204
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
that

205
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,440
composition that's been identified

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,400
uh which tells us uh

207
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,160
the abundance of that mineral present

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
relative to one another

209
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,599
and then also you can look at the

210
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,039
crystallinity which is based off the

211
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,440
full wave half max

212
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,960
at half minimum value so it's basically

213
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,360
looking halfway up

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
that peak and looking at the

215
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,720
the size of that um heat

216
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,759
so in the study i've done this for the

217
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
major and minor

218
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,800
silica and sulfide mineral groups found

219
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,240
most

220
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,520
regularly in the deposit which include

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,560
epidotes smectites white micas

222
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,680
amphiboles carbonate chlorides

223
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,680
and also sulfides

224
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,840
meaning that with the ip and opmag sus

225
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,720
data

226
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,720
i have a 29 dimensional dataset

227
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
and as you can probably appreciate and

228
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,000
imagine

229
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
this is very hard to visualize and get

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
any useful information out of

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
without doing some sort of uh

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,919
statistical

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,320
uh using some sort of statistical method

234
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,919
um

235
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,240
but what i've done is along with

236
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
colleagues in nazarbayev university is

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,519
come up with this new and novel

238
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,720
uh machine learning algorithm uh

239
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,839
which looks at all this data and splits

240
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,880
it apart into

241
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,399
its most representative

242
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,120
groups of data so i'm not going to dwell

243
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,279
too much on the mat but here is a quick

244
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,760
explanation

245
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,120
so imagine in a high dimensional space

246
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,320
we're going to measure the

247
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,080
similarities between points which is

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,600
defined as p i j in this case

249
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,920
and we're going to do that in a way that

250
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,800
we just look at the local similarities

251
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,920
to that one point so imagine a point in

252
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
that data set being

253
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,680
x i and then and we

254
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,800
center a gash on over that point we're

255
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
going to then measure

256
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,399
the density of all the points within

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,440
this

258
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,160
in this case uh on this equation x

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,839
i at x j and then we're going to

260
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,600
re-normalize all this

261
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,440
with the bottom which is what the bottom

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,640
part of the fraction

263
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
on the screen does so when you when we

264
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,839
run this

265
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
for all the points in the data set we

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,880
have a set of probabilities

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,279
of p i j for each

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,720
data point which measure the similarity

269
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,160
between pairs of points

270
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,600
in the original high dimensional space

271
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,720
so if the points are close together in

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,519
high dimensional space

273
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,240
then we'll have a large value of p i j

274
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,200
and if the two points are far apart

275
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,760
then we'll get a p i j which is

276
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
basically

277
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,720
infant decimal so now imagine

278
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,160
a two dimensional xy plot which

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,399
i'm saying is low dimensional space and

280
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,440
this is what we want the data to be

281
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,040
simplified down

282
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,519
into and represented in

283
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,160
and i represent each high dimensional

284
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,000
object

285
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,320
in this low dimensional map with an

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,320
arbitrary position point to begin with

287
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
and repeat the same thing calculating

288
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,000
the procedure

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,959
uh calculating to produce a similarity

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,839
measure

291
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:59,200
of q i j in the low dimensional space

292
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,560
and then if we take

293
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,480
this curvat libra divergence we're going

294
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,200
to measure which measures the difference

295
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
between the p

296
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
i j value in high dimensional space and

297
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,839
the q i j values

298
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,360
from the low dimensional like space

299
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,480
um we

300
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,839
want as iterations of this algorithm

301
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,040
take place we want the

302
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,320
curvature for diversions to become as

303
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,839
small as possible

304
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
with the aim to be getting it down to

305
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,959
zero

306
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,800
um but obviously that doesn't always

307
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,640
take place like

308
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,000
and you just have to stop the algorithm

309
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,600
when it gets close to zero

310
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,519
or flat lines so currently

311
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,880
i have a magnetic accessibility and high

312
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,760
spectral data set that

313
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,600
is 5018 at 5814 strong

314
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,800
with a further 4581

315
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,680
still to measure um obviously this

316
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,320
becomes

317
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,360
quite computationally expensive to run

318
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,760
um

319
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,959
and it takes currently about five days

320
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,360
with the current data however

321
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,880
so that you can imagine the picture and

322
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,760
imagine a picture what is going

323
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,959
on uh with the different iterations i

324
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,959
have put together

325
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,160
this sort of interactive graph which

326
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,320
goes through

327
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,440
periodic in uh iterations

328
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,760
up to a total of like 400

329
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,120
um where you will see the curveback

330
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,200
libor divergence

331
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,480
being stopping at 0.49 but

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,760
if i let uh this run fully

333
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,959
until the curb liver divergence is

334
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,920
actually at point stops at point zero

335
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,000
three

336
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,440
um you that's my final

337
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,560
outcome which once this is finished

338
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,399
i will show you yeah

339
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:06,639
so that's that finished and this is the

340
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:09,279
outcome where the colors all represent

341
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,839
uh the 12 different clusters that have

342
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,120
been identified

343
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,800
so let us first just concentrate on

344
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,839
these the three green clusters here

345
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,200
which would all fall into traditional

346
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:29,200
propriolytic alteration zone as can be

347
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:33,040
seen with these three sample images

348
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,680
which i don't know about you but

349
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
i wouldn't necessarily always be able to

350
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,920
pick apart

351
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,959
or identify them as different things

352
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,079
there are slight differences but yeah

353
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,279
um so now if we first look at some

354
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,959
ams data then we can see for this purple

355
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,800
point down in the bottom

356
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,279
left of the gra bottom left

357
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,279
cluster

358
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,519
we have unique ip and op results

359
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,519
which isn't the case in the other two

360
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,760
clusters

361
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,000
however the other two have very

362
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,720
different tx results

363
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,600
where you have this group being

364
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,120
dominated by magnetite

365
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
but with very little change in

366
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,040
mineralogy and heating

367
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,160
and in complete contrast with the upper

368
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,199
cluster here

369
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,639
then we have

370
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:32,399
magnetite present but with the heating

371
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,880
forms uh no new phrases

372
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,399
so yeah that bottom bit you've got

373
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,920
pyrotype forming

374
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,360
with another phase and in the upper one

375
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,399
you've got not much forming it's

376
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,839
almost reproducible so if we now

377
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,959
go back to the full graph

378
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,199
and we uh

379
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,560
focus on this blue group which would

380
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
fall into philic alter

381
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,600
into the traditional phillip alteration

382
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
zone

383
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,880
again which can be seen by these two

384
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:10,560
data points that i've got images for

385
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:14,000
then we can also have

386
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:18,079
distinct ams results as well where

387
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,720
this group has

388
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,600
orange data point has distinct ip and op

389
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,399
ams results

390
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,120
however in this red group below then you

391
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,160
don't have

392
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,360
distinct ip and op ams results

393
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,800
timing there ali okay um

394
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,680
so now if we go back to the full graph

395
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,720
and isolate the orange group again and

396
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,240
this is the

397
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,240
our gaelic and advanced argument

398
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,440
alteration again i'll

399
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,399
go through all these for timing uh

400
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,839
but if we look at uh the tx results here

401
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,120
then we can see that this

402
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,920
top one you get the

403
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,920
complete er

404
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,680
you get the complete uh destruction

405
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,279
almost of magnetite

406
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,680
but then no parasite forming but in the

407
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,959
bottom one here you get pyrotype forming

408
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,320
from the magnetite

409
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,680
that was there originally

410
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,959
and so then go back to this last one

411
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,360
and we focus on this potassic alteration

412
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,839
which

413
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
actually is different to the others

414
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,759
because it's

415
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,680
got a very large statistical difference

416
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,839
that's been identified

417
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,160
between this one and this sample

418
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,399
um and then we actually this time look

419
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,519
at field dependent ams

420
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,399
then we can see the top top clusters in

421
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,600
the

422
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,320
minimum and intermediate axes then

423
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,000
it is field dependent in outer phase but

424
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,720
not in phase

425
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,199
whereas in the in phase and outer phase

426
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,480
for the

427
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,560
bottom uh cluster then it's neither

428
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
field dependent in either outer phase or

429
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,959
in phase

430
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,279
so what's next with this so as you can

431
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,880
see i've got a lot more work to do

432
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,480
to collect a suite of magnetic

433
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
characterization data

434
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,400
that will allow me to determine the very

435
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,160
subtle differences that the algorithm

436
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,439
is identifying between the different

437
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,959
clusters

438
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,079
and maybe even incorporate some more

439
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,720
magnetic statistics into the algorithm

440
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,559
i would also and it would be really cool

441
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,000
to be able to identify

442
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,480
um uh incorporate textural analysis

443
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,160
into the algorithm as well so the

444
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,600
clusters are based off both the rock

445
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,120
texture as well as the quantitative

446
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,400
mineral data

447
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,679
but let's um just leave you

448
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,160
with the final thought of my end goal

449
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
here

450
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,720
which is for the usefulness of this

451
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,280
method within industry to be fully used

452
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,640
to

453
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,240
help aid in more detailed mind modelling

454
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,960
and ultimately more efficient extraction

455
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,360
process

456
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
to achieve this then the collection of

457
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,160
the data

458
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,520
that i'm using will need to be fully

459
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,080
automated and

460
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,840
allow for multi as i said large

461
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,360
multi-billion pound mining projects

462
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,960
to collect large quantities of data um

463
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,840
really quickly and easily are there any

464
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,840
questions and thank you for listening

465
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,160
right question yeah

466
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,000
yeah very nice talk again thank you um i

467
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,000
was gonna i was wondering to what extent

468
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,120
that the addition of the magnetic

469
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,679
uh component to your 29

470
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
parameter space makes a difference i

471
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
mean do you have you compared the

472
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
clustering

473
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,120
output that you get with and without the

474
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,760
magnetic

475
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,039
input so just based purely on the

476
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,480
spectroscopy versus

477
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,200
spectroscopy plus the magnetic i mean to

478
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,720
how how i guess what i get trying to get

479
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,840
is is how much is your clustering

480
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,120
dictated by the

481
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,679
sort of the spectra the spectrum so i've

482
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
done

483
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,880
uh how much

484
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,640
additional added value do you get by

485
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,240
adding in the magnetism

486
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,480
yeah so with the um with the

487
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,000
algorithm it basically calculates that

488
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,400
uh how much

489
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,480
it's been dominated by each of the

490
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
different um

491
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,160
inputs and so the outer phase and in

492
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,200
phase

493
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,440
you get back it changes slightly

494
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,400
depending on the exact data set that you

495
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,039
run and how large that is but it's on

496
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,360
the region

497
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,840
of like with in phase and out of phase

498
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,799
of about 33 to 40

499
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,080
so it's quite significant um and that's

500
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,760
one of the reasons that i'd like

501
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,880
to incorporate more magnetic data

502
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,320
because actually

503
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,960
then hopefully that would produce more

504
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
data there to pull apart the differences

505
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,120
that

506
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,679
are obviously present statistically but

507
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,160
i haven't got the current data to sort

508
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,520
of

509
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,600
do that if i make it and i hope that

510
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,320
answer is yeah no

511
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,240
that answers exactly my question you can

512
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,280
actually quantify it you know

513
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,120
yeah thank you

514
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,480
hi oliver i i mean i've got a sort of

515
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,120
similar um

516
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,960
uh questions i mean yeah i'm assuming

517
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,480
that um

518
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,159
you're on mixing algorithms essentially

519
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,360
it's kind of an unsupervised

520
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,919
um algorithm so it's essentially

521
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,280
fitting the the end member spectrum

522
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,159
based upon the data that you

523
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,000
input is that correct yeah i mean have

524
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,600
you tried so that there are

525
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,360
you know catalogues of uh spectra for a

526
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,960
wide range of minerals

527
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,080
um because they often will have a a um

528
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,280
a defined um uh spectrum for for the

529
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
individual minerals

530
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
there's some variation there but have

531
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,520
you actually tried doing a sort of semi

532
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,559
supervised on mixing where you

533
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,000
are using a library of the spectra for

534
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,039
uh the minerals and then you're using a

535
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
essentially trying to find matching um

536
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,480
your data to this

537
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,159
library as opposed to to taking all the

538
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,200
information purely from

539
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,159
uh the the data set yeah

540
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,799
yeah so i have tried that and one of the

541
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,000
sort of

542
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,679
issues there is that obviously you get

543
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,720
a spectral measurement for a bulk rock

544
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,039
and the mineral libraries are single

545
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,080
minerals and therefore you can

546
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:32,400
very easily like identify

547
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:37,039
um minerals that it thinks are

548
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,039
present but are clearly not um

549
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,280
but like um going into the future

550
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,320
like it would be so the the actual

551
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,400
algorithm

552
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,760
that the statistical algorithm to

553
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,440
cluster

554
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,679
will learn these as more and more more

555
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,799
and

556
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,360
more data gets like run through

557
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,480
then it will learn where these clusters

558
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,840
are appearing

559
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,280
and um

560
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,760
like that will then form the beginning

561
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,159
part

562
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,720
of the new like data that you run

563
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,320
through if that makes sense i

564
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,240
does that fully answer your question i'm

565
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,240
not entirely sure but yeah

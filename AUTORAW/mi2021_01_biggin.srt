1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,160
okay is that visible

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,480
to people thumbs up right yep okay

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,480
excellent all right well thank you very

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,280
much uh for the kind introduction

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,960
will um and as first speaker um i will

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
say yeah very big thank you to

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,840
to will and lot and anybody else for

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,039
setting this up it's great to see so

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,960
many people um

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
uh here we're looking forward to this

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,359
okay so um

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,000
yeah i'm going for uh an award for the

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,119
most co-authors on a talk here

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,600
um but fully justified of course um

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,559
because this this talk is kind of a

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
quite high level

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,239
overview with kind of a trunk of a tree

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,559
i guess where it's kind of branching off

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,640
to

20
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,239
to uh other people's presentations and

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,239
recent recent papers

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
and so on um but there is a kind of

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,360
tight theme which is

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,039
integrating early magnetic data with

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
with numerical dynamo simulations and

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,559
that's

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,440
central to to what we're trying to do um

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,800
in liverpool

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,399
and was the topic of a workshop we had

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,320
about a year and a half ago

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,600
before all this covered nonsense started

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,520
um

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
in wales so that's where this photo is

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,560
from um here

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
okay so this is a very broad

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
introduction

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
so when paleomagnetists and this will be

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,240
a talk primarily

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
for paleomagnetism um when we talk about

40
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,799
models

41
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,880
uh more often than not we're referring

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,080
to to field models based on

43
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,200
spherical harmonic descriptions um uh

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,159
of the real field uh to some degree

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,360
um so these can be time varying like

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
these ones

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,320
this one over here figures this is ggf

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
100k so the longest time varying model

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
um that we have last hundred thousand

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,479
years

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,680
um or they can be statistical um

52
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,880
so uh no real times every draw from the

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
model is a single

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
instant snapshot uh in time and here

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
we're not looking for the time

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
series then we're looking at um mean

57
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,799
values

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
being paleomagnetic pole latitudes shown

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
up here here at the top

60
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,840
um and the shapes of distributions in in

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,360
this case for virtual geomagnetic

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,160
poles sampled different uh latitudes

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
uh now both these models um more

64
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,239
generally why models are so useful

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,000
is is um that they give global coverage

66
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,879
okay so they will

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,879
they're designed to match um

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,879
paleomagnetic data from from specific

69
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,879
places um

70
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
but the idea is they fill in the gaps

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,319
everywhere else on the surface of the

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,780
earth so you can go anywhere and ask

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,879
what the field was doing

74
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,360
[Music]

75
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,040
but something that is highly pertinent

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
to these sorts of models

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
is that they're not physics-based so

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,760
that's not to say that they're

79
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,160
unphysical uh physics uh creeps in there

80
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,000
from

81
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,239
from the rules that are associated with

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,959
the the how the spherical harmonics

83
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
uh relate uh to each other and the power

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,160
spectrum

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,920
um but that comes in from from

86
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
observations of the recent field not

87
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,120
from any um

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,120
uh physical uh processes um

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,040
but you know the first order of the

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
physics of what's producing the magnetic

91
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,400
field

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,480
is you know fairly well understood

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,800
so it's in dynamo theory so essentially

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,760
we have a rapidly rotating spherical

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,159
shell

96
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,120
the outer core filled with conductive

97
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
fluid

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,720
that is convecting and there's a dynamic

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
process going on that's generating

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,080
as it passes through the existing

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,799
magnetic field generating more magnetic

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
field so

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
this is more or less the entirety of the

104
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
equations that you have to solve

105
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,159
don't worry i'm not going to go through

106
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,159
them but just point out that

107
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,920
workstations or supercomputers you can

108
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,840
simultaneously solve

109
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
these equations and time step through

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,640
the dynamic process

111
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,519
producing as a result an output that is

112
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,120
a magnetic field as viewed at the

113
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
surface which is what of course is

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,799
paleomagnetism we're interested in

115
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,439
now any model has input parameters so

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,159
these are

117
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,799
kind of the tuning knobs i guess for um

118
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,879
for what you

119
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,080
you twiddle to get the model to behave

120
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,840
in a different way

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,519
and the primary ones for dynamo models

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,160
are these dimensional four dimensionless

123
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
numbers here i'll only mention two of

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
them briefly one of them the ekman

125
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
number

126
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,720
so this is the ratio of um viscous

127
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,000
coriolis forces and this is

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,720
extremely small in the earth like 10

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,919
to the minus 16. um in the models we

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
can't get down to

131
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,400
that such low values uh where um

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,160
11 or 12 volts of magnitude uh higher

133
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
than this so that means we're ramping up

134
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,280
the viscosity and

135
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
the reason for this is that that

136
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,560
suppresses all the small scale

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,240
um turbulence which we couldn't hope to

138
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,199
simulate even in our

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,560
fastest uh supercomputers the other one

140
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
i'll mention is the rayleigh number

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
so hopefully many of you familiar with

142
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,560
this already that describes the

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,759
um what defines the the bigger of the um

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,479
the convection

145
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,800
um in the system this we have to ramp up

146
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,080
artificially high to overcome this

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
this enhanced viscosity um now so that

148
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
means that we're not in the earth like

149
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,600
regime

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,680
in these um but there is a whole wealth

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
of literature out there and to kind of

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
sum up

153
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
i guess the state of the art as i

154
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,919
understand it we're more or less in a

155
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,800
place

156
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,919
now where the false balance um is

157
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,479
arguably

158
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,000
the same as in the earth uh and so for

159
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
all extents and purposes that we're

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,919
interested in the resource large scale

161
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,160
features of the field emerging at the

162
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,639
the surface

163
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,360
[Music]

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,440
yeah there's arguably realistic we are

165
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
uh we are generating an earth-like

166
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,520
process

167
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,639
okay so here's some some models here

168
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
shown on the left here we've got a

169
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,039
fairly recent one by julian ober

170
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
and co-authors high-resolution model

171
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,880
we're showing the

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
um velocity of the flow uh in the core

173
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,639
here and you

174
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
might be able to make out there's

175
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,600
different flow structures inside and

176
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
outside this

177
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,440
inner core tangent cylinder so that's

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,440
aligned

179
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,479
around the inner core in the direction

180
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,880
of the rotation

181
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,680
um axis and here we've got some some

182
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,800
outputs

183
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,919
and uh there's from paper from lulia in

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,319
2013

185
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,000
and we've got a nice time series here

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,759
where we've got a reversal

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,759
shown in there a few things that kind of

188
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,560
look a bit like small excursions and

189
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
we've got the

190
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
dipole moment going uh up and down and

191
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,919
you know what could look like a

192
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
plausible manner

193
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
um so dynamic models produce time

194
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,479
varying

195
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
outputs are these time series but we of

196
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,440
course

197
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,440
these well apart from some things that

198
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,840
julian has done on the very recent field

199
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,759
of

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,120
um and others have worked on data

201
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,680
assimilation where

202
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
try to mimic the the very recent field

203
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
uh without exception

204
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,919
other time series that you'll see from

205
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
dynamic models are the ones that we're

206
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
using

207
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,520
they're not trying to replicate any

208
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,319
particular point in history

209
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,720
of um of the earth's magnetic field so

210
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,440
you

211
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,360
treat these time simulations as a dynamo

212
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
as the outputs of a dynamic process not

213
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,400
the geodynamo

214
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,560
and you look at them in a statistical

215
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
sense um but similar to the field models

216
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,440
they give

217
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,479
global coverage and now at least you

218
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,160
know

219
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,319
they are based in the physics rather

220
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,440
than just being you know geometrical

221
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,639
descriptions of the field okay so

222
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,160
we tend to use um as paleomagnetists you

223
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
know we we do use field models

224
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
particularly

225
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
uh archaeo magnets use time varying

226
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
field models

227
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,599
a lot and paleomagnetists use

228
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
statistical field models a lot so

229
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,599
to test whether there are directions of

230
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,479
average secular variation for example

231
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,520
um and to correct for inclination uh

232
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,319
shadowing using the

233
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,479
ei technique based on the tko3 model

234
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
but we don't tend to use dynamo models

235
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
okay and

236
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,400
we're looking to to try and maybe change

237
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,919
that uh because there's some good

238
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,479
reasons why we should be using

239
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
uh diamond models so as i've said you

240
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,199
know the outputs the

241
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,360
physics-based dynamically

242
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,280
self-consistent uh we have the potential

243
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
for extremely long time series

244
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
so time varying models you know i got to

245
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,240
100 000 years

246
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
at the most you know we can produce

247
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
things that are tens hundreds of

248
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,639
millions of years

249
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,319
um long and um

250
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
i guess the the big cell for dynamo

251
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
models is that because it's related to

252
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,599
the physics of

253
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
of the the core and the deep earth we

254
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
have the potential to recover

255
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,759
information then about what saying what

256
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,639
our results mean

257
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
uh not only for the field but also for

258
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,919
um for article dynamics

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,919
and mental forcing and core evolution

260
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
and so on um

261
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,519
but there are some uh some negatives as

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
well that have to bear in mind with

263
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,080
dynamic models first is that these

264
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,640
they're all

265
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,719
dimensionless essentially so that's fine

266
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,760
for directions and directions that's all

267
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,959
that's all okay um but for intensities

268
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,120
and for time

269
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,880
um these need to be scaled so the models

270
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,880
need to be calibrated and

271
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,040
there are some uncertainties associated

272
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,040
with that with that calibration

273
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,560
um they're very computationally

274
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,880
expensive to run

275
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,480
and that said what you emerged that

276
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,160
we're mostly interested in is time

277
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
series of gauss coefficients it's

278
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
exactly the same as you'd have from

279
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,040
a time bearing model so you can then

280
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,160
play around with the outputs of them in

281
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,680
the same way as you would

282
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,920
with a time varying model you'll need to

283
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,440
run them uh actually once

284
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,200
uh and then this final point that i

285
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,360
think gets to the nub of why

286
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
we don't use them more is that yeah

287
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
perimeters dynamic modelers

288
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,880
you know just don't talk to each other

289
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
um very much there's some notable

290
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,600
exceptions in the past so

291
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,440
um mcfadden michael hinney and merrell

292
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,640
um did some good work great work in the

293
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,600
90s and

294
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,800
um robco and gary glatzmeyer they've

295
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
done some work in the

296
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
uh and the naughties more recently um

297
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
but other than that

298
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,000
generally there's been a there's been a

299
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,000
gap between um

300
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
these two communities that we're trying

301
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,480
to trying to bridge

302
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
because there's some some really good

303
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,200
reasons to do that um

304
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,120
because over here we've got

305
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
paleomagnetic measurements so clearly

306
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
observations

307
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
of the real world but they have the

308
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,320
problems that

309
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
they're especially temporarily

310
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
restricted

311
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,240
and where the data can come from and

312
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,240
we've got the

313
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,240
error and bias associated with with the

314
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,519
measurement processes themselves and

315
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
recording processes

316
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,959
and over here geodynamic model outputs

317
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
so yep the

318
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,320
the you know predictions from a

319
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680
simulated

320
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,160
um geodynamic process uh they give

321
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,959
you know perfect coverage so complete

322
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
global and

323
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,040
get them we tend to use one through the

324
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
time step of around 65 years

325
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,320
so that's a pretty high resolution

326
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,560
temporal resolution

327
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,839
um but of course we require constraints

328
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,959
and observations

329
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,000
so how can um these two areas help each

330
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,480
other well i've

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
kind of noted that down as a series of

332
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,279
research questions that are going to be

333
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,040
covered in the rest of this talk so

334
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,440
we have we can ask how realistic

335
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
these models are and what input

336
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,279
parameters

337
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,320
best produces realism and going the

338
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,320
other way what can the

339
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,399
how can the models help um our

340
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
measurements uh they can tell us about

341
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,079
the

342
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,279
ancient us um the magnetic field give us

343
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
more information than just our

344
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,839
measurements do

345
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,320
and about the uh the source of that as

346
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,760
well

347
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,040
okay so um

348
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,800
first question how realistic are the

349
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,920
models so when we first came to this we

350
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
thought this you know we're not the

351
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
first to think about this and we thought

352
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,560
this problem was solved

353
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,720
um because there are already criteria

354
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,920
out there um

355
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,920
so notably other christians criteria

356
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,120
from 2010 and these certainly there's a

357
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,800
whole bunch of models and they are

358
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,079
earth-like and they're all good but then

359
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,279
we looked at them

360
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,959
details started comparing them to

361
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,800
paleomagnetic datasets rather than just

362
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,320
stuff from the the recent field

363
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,560
and we found that there's a whole host

364
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,920
of problems which um

365
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,399
i've kind of listed here and i'll give

366
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,920
you some examples down here from one of

367
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
the early models we looked at so this

368
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,040
one you know it reverses

369
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,720
um great um this inclination normally is

370
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
huge you know 16 degrees

371
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,240
inclination anomaly so that would be a

372
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
real problem for uh plate tectonic

373
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,079
reconstructions there's no evidence of

374
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,839
sport

375
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,000
at least in the last 10 million years or

376
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,600
so and the other big problem we found

377
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,240
was that paleosecular variation was

378
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
often very

379
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
unearth-like so we'd expect vgp

380
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
dispersion angular dispersion to be

381
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,480
about

382
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,839
11 degrees or something that's what we

383
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
see for the last 10 million years and

384
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,880
here it's up in the

385
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,240
you know the mid-20s or something at low

386
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,959
latitude and

387
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,880
increasing with latitude as we do see so

388
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,000
we had this whole bunch of problems

389
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,279
uh with all our simulations so we built

390
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
up 46

391
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,480
and we wanted some way to say okay which

392
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
ones are more accurate than the others

393
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
and

394
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,880
how are they um inaccurate uh so

395
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,360
this was worked by um by courtney sprain

396
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,760
um she published this paper in 2009

397
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,959
on the qpm criteria so set of five

398
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
criteria i'm not going to go through

399
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,800
them all

400
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,079
um just to say you can see from this bar

401
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,160
chart over here

402
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,440
um that we've got a lot of big red

403
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,200
columns so

404
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
most of the models failed most of the

405
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
criteria

406
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,079
so you can have a maximum qpm score of

407
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,279
five if you're meeting all five but we

408
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,880
don't even go up to that on the scale

409
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,920
because none of them went above

410
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,240
three okay and the other question is is

411
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
this misfit so this is based on the

412
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
normalization

413
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,120
uh of the um the discrepancy in

414
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,200
uh the simulated and the reference

415
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
values but also taking into account the

416
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,839
uncertainties

417
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,959
as well and what we found

418
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,680
uh for these um is that we never got

419
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,079
below

420
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,720
this magic number of five which means

421
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,800
that we

422
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
yeah five is is a good number because

423
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,399
that means on average then

424
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,720
all of our criteria are within um errors

425
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,680
of one another uh so we scratched our

426
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,279
heads a little bit

427
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,480
and um went to work on this and

428
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,760
domenico midori uh liverpool

429
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
did some great work on this and the

430
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,480
first thing he found was

431
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,760
that we have this nice we tended when

432
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
you plot the models together you tend to

433
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,360
get this nice parabola shape

434
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,079
in this space where you've got the qpm

435
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,880
misfit here with five as magic number

436
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,720
down here uh against the die polarity so

437
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
how much does a dipole dominate at the

438
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,199
core mantle boundary

439
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,880
and where these things dipped uh to

440
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,560
their lowest misfit to the most

441
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,399
realistic models was also

442
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,240
a roundabout within areas of where

443
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
earth-like models were predicting

444
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,040
uh of where sorry um descriptive field

445
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,920
models were predicting the dipolarity

446
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,800
uh to be as well but a lot of models

447
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,240
never really got

448
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,680
never got close to this this um this

449
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,279
magic line of

450
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,839
five um and what we actually found was

451
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,800
that it

452
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,480
it required then to go to chemical

453
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,680
chemically forced models so models

454
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,120
purely driven

455
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,720
by the growth of the inner core and the

456
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,800
release of light elements there rather

457
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,880
than by thermal convection

458
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,320
um but once we did that then we did find

459
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,800
some models that did dip in

460
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,240
into this area um we didn't find

461
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,320
anything that was absolutely perfect

462
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,360
with a qpm of five but we did get to a

463
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,240
misfit of about two and a half

464
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,959
um so this is our model with the lowest

465
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,160
misfit

466
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,920
and where it falls down um in terms of

467
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,279
failing criteria is it doesn't reverse

468
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,480
quite enough so you can see it's got a

469
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,199
nice earth like

470
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,720
reversal in there and excursions but

471
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,720
they're just not frequent enough to

472
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
uh to represent the last 10 million

473
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,600
years

474
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,199
okay now an interesting we've got a nice

475
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
dipolar shape and we've got this

476
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,839
variability in

477
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,279
dipole moment that appears earth

478
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,759
uh now an interesting observation to

479
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,959
make from this is that if you take

480
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,320
th this model and you just you you

481
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,600
change nothing about it apart from the

482
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,639
rayleigh number you force it a little

483
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,360
bit harder you change the rayleigh

484
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,000
number 4.6 to 1.8 times 10 to the 7 so

485
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,079
that's

486
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
just sucking the heat out of the core a

487
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,880
little bit faster allowing the unicorn

488
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
to grow a bit faster

489
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,839
and suddenly you've got a completely

490
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,120
different model that's now got reversal

491
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,720
hyperactivity

492
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,800
uh in there it's looking a lot less

493
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,160
dipolar and it's looking a lot weaker as

494
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,519
well so this is really

495
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,800
supporting that you don't need to do

496
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:03,040
much to the geodynamo to make it

497
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:07,279
change its behavior quite radically um

498
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,839
okay so we got to uh to near enough our

499
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,120
most earth-like model um but that's not

500
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,880
to say that all the ones that weren't

501
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
earth-like weren't also really useful

502
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,880
for us

503
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,199
um so one thing that richard bono

504
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
um worked on was looking at all the

505
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,360
models and finding

506
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,560
that they all contained um or a large

507
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,279
number of them contain

508
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,759
systematic um covariance between

509
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,160
different

510
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,759
spherical harmonic terms within them so

511
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,839
for example this first what this first

512
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,480
column is showing is that to increase g1

513
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,600
0

514
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,480
you also tend to increase g30 the axial

515
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,759
octopole goes with the axial dipole now

516
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,199
the reason this was interesting is

517
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,000
because our statistical field models at

518
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,600
the moment

519
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,440
from something called a giant gaussian

520
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,120
process where all these terms

521
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,800
act completely independently of each

522
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,199
other and the dynamo models were saying

523
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
well

524
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,880
you know that's actually not what's

525
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,199
happening in at least you know

526
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,519
in these simulations uh so what richard

527
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,279
did then was try to incorporate this

528
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,919
this covariance into a giant gaussian

529
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,360
process model and what he found was that

530
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,959
the resulting uh

531
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,120
um fit to data improved

532
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,400
quite markedly so what are our

533
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,959
measurements telling us

534
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,160
well perhaps that the um the earth also

535
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,360
has this covariance between these

536
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,880
different terms and that's telling us

537
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,199
something about the structures

538
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,039
um of the that are generating the

539
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,199
magnetic field

540
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,400
so another aspect that was really useful

541
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,480
it's up there andy you're

542
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,520
you're a good you're a few couple of

543
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,120
minutes left there

544
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,720
couple of minutes left okay i'll i'll

545
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,160
wrap up so this is just pointing another

546
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,440
paper that's very recently

547
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,240
um accepted um which was

548
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,679
yeah linking um the shape of the field

549
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,799
to its variability

550
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
um so what we found was that as you you

551
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,640
vary the field

552
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,679
um as sorry as the field becomes more

553
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
variable

554
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,480
then you see that it's it becomes less

555
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,960
uh dominated by an axial dipole it looks

556
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,640
less

557
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,840
like a bar magnet and this was really

558
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,880
interesting because

559
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,000
we don't have any measurements of axial

560
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,520
dipole dominance from before um a few

561
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,760
million years ago whereas we have

562
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,400
measurements of paleosecular variation

563
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
back to billions of years ago and got a

564
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,440
nice

565
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,360
power law predictive power law that came

566
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,840
out from all our simulations and from

567
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,280
field models as well uh so we're able to

568
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,720
say something about the

569
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
um about how dipole uh axial dipole

570
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,600
dominance

571
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,880
has uh has changed through geological

572
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,400
history and

573
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,840
uh the big um uh the key point to emerge

574
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,720
from that is not very much

575
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,000
so the field didn't often look like this

576
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,000
or like this

577
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
in actual fact it spent most of its time

578
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,480
looking like this which is igrf all

579
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,960
right which is today's field

580
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,880
okay so something else that's told us so

581
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,679
just a quick future application

582
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,360
um so just to point out that we've been

583
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,480
also been doing a huge amount of work at

584
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
liverpool on

585
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,760
measuring um the properties of the

586
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,799
paleomagnetic field back through

587
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,280
geological time

588
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,160
and uh these yellow points show our

589
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,520
efforts at

590
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,360
um increasing the number of estimates of

591
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,799
dipole moment through geological time in

592
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,840
the last five years

593
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,360
and uh what we've outlined are um yeah

594
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,080
it's two periods in particular where the

595
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
field was

596
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,360
appears to be radically different in

597
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,720
that is much weaker um

598
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,080
than today um so you know a big question

599
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,240
of how we go forward

600
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,160
uh with with dynamo models is can we

601
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,000
capture this behavior like we have done

602
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,880
for the last 10 million years as well

603
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,640
okay and if we can then knowing how we

604
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,919
have to perturb our present day model

605
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,280
to um to simulate a field looking like

606
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,880
these we might be able to say something

607
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,200
about how the physical properties

608
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
of the deep earth have um have changed

609
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,400
over time

610
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,919
okay so i'm out of time so i'll just

611
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,919
leave my summary slide up there thank

612
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,880
you

613
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
oh

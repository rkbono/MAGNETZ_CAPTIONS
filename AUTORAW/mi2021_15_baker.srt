1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
come now to the law session of

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,000
this conference uh

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,679
titled new developments in magnetic

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,960
theory and techniques

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,400
and our four first talk is by evelyn

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,080
baker at all title uh prices based model

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,600
on chemical remnant magnetization

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,760
equities acquisition

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,039
and comparisons to thermo remnant

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,560
magnetizations

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,560
so you can take it away and share your

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,200
scheme

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,559
everyone see my screen yes

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,320
okay cool um so yeah i'm evie um

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,160
and we've been modeling chemical

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,280
remnantization acquisition by using

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,120
plastic theory

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
um along with my supervisors and we've

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,600
also been making some comparisons to

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,360
thermal remnant magnetizations

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,239
so there we go so first i'm just going

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,960
to talk briefly about um what a crm is

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,079
um just kind of to remind everyone so a

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
com is recorded

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,520
when magnetic minerals grow through the

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,199
blocking volume

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
and then they record the earth's field

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,560
um as they go through the bottom volume

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
and can no longer respond to changes in

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
the magnetic field

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
um and this can occur this occurs below

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,640
the kiwi temperature

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,200
so there are two main categories of crms

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,759
these are a growth crm so this occurs

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
when

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
magnetic minerals grow in a non-magnetic

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
matrix

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
so examples of this are hematite

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,360
precipitation in red beds and also you

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
can see here in this

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,600
um backscatter electron image that um

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,119
this is for a marine sediment

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
you can see that you have these pyrite

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,880
um kind of fanboys here marked by the p

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
and you can see that greg eye is

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,240
precipitated here marked by the g

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,759
um in between these these pyrite fanboys

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,720
which has shown that it's precipitated

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,119
orthogenically

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,079
and is therefore recordedly crm um as it

51
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,159
grew

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,079
and the second type of crms is an

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,960
alteration crm so these occur when

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,719
minerals alter to form magnetic minerals

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,640
these can be more complex because if you

56
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
have a magnetic precursor the field

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
that's recorded

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,600
is a combination of the earth's field

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,119
and also fields associated with that

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,239
primary magnetic phase

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,239
so things like exchange interactions and

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,879
crms occur in almost all environments on

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,599
earth

64
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
and in the solar system and so it's

65
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,800
important to kind of understand their

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,599
properties and what sort of remnants

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
they have

68
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,599
and um you know if there's a crm

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,959
component to our trms how is that

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
affecting paid intensity estimates

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
that's why we're trying to

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,959
learn more about them so now i'm going

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
to talk about

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,239
kind of what works previously been done

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
because there's been a lot of study on

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
crms

77
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,680
um today so the studies previously have

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
come from a theoretical or an

79
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,920
experimental perspective

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,599
so from the theoretical angle um people

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,080
have modeled

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,280
or made predictions on comm behavior by

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
using the al's theory for

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,920
non-interacting single-domain grains

85
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760
and made predictions for example about

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,440
the serum intensity um

87
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,519
and the unblocking spectra and some

88
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,959
comparisons to trms

89
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,560
and other other studies have used

90
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
modelling of green growth crms so

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,680
there's been monte carlo simulations

92
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,680
which have included interactions

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
um and they've looked at the com

94
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,920
intensity and also again the the effect

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,000
on blocking spectra at high temperatures

96
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,120
um and alongside this theoretical

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
studies there's been

98
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,519
a lot of experimental studies and these

99
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,239
have included a wide range of minerals

100
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
and uh looking at lots of different um

101
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,400
types of crm acquisition so grain growth

102
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
com and onto the alteration

103
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
so in this figure here in the middle

104
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,360
graph you can see that the cm intensity

105
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,519
um you can see how the serum intensity

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
varies with changes in the applied field

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,239
and these are for experimental um

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,120
studies looking at hematite so about

109
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,519
90 degrees they precipitate hematite um

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,959
either in like a non-magnetic matrix or

111
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
or from the alteration of non-magnetic

112
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
mineral and you can see that you get

113
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
this linear relationship between the

114
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,519
comm intensity and the applied field

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
which is kind of what we'd expect which

116
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
shows that you know cms

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,319
should be able to be modeled or looked

118
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,319
at so what are we doing so for our study

119
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
we've developed a or we're developing a

120
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
model of cm acquisition for

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,239
interacting single domain grains and

122
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,599
we're doing this in physics space

123
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
and what this allows us to do is it

124
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
allows us to use the thought diagrams as

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,720
input for the for the model

126
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,000
which allows us to model crms for

127
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,680
specific samples um

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,280
so firstly i'm gonna try and give you a

129
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,440
brief overview of

130
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
the um thermally activated present model

131
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,960
for randomly orientated single domain

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,199
grains which we use

133
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,680
so prysic theory is a statistical

134
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,600
approach to modelling magnetic processes

135
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,040
so instead of trying to model each

136
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
visual grain in the sample

137
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,720
we're trying to model the statistical

138
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
behavior or the behavior of the magnetic

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
assemblies

140
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,199
as a whole um and we do this by by using

141
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
isaac theory

142
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,080
oh i'll go back again so if you see here

143
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
um on the right hand side this is kind

144
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,040
of plasic space and you can see that

145
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,000
it's split into

146
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,840
four regions or three regions so you've

147
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,919
got the field blocked regions and the

148
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,479
super paramagnetic regions and in in

149
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,199
these zones if a particle or a histogram

150
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,560
lies

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,680
in this part of the plastic diagram it

152
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
won't be recording a remnant

153
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,039
magnetization

154
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,800
and then we have this green region which

155
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,600
is a thermally blocked region and this

156
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
is where

157
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,039
um particles or histones which lie in

158
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
this zone will be

159
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,199
um recording or will have acquired and

160
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,240
be recording and contributing to the

161
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,400
to the magnetic remnants so

162
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
these uh thermal critical curve shown in

163
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,360
black and

164
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
and the price distribution here vary

165
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
with time and

166
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,560
thermal effect so these move during

167
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,080
monetization processes

168
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,840
um and we can kind of model how these

169
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,039
change relative to each other to to see

170
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
kind of what monetization we're

171
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,800
acquiring

172
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,639
so um the way we populate pricing space

173
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,560
is we use a thought diagram so

174
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,000
if you use a plastic diagram which is

175
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,080
kind of similar to a fort diagram but

176
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
symmetric concussivity axis

177
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,520
if you you can see how it kind of

178
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,080
rotates 45 degrees and can be used to

179
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,919
populate plastic space here

180
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,600
um and then what this allows us to do is

181
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,039
it allows us to populate isaac space the

182
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
large number of historians and then we

183
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,560
can track how these historians behave

184
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,319
during crm acquisition for example um

185
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
relative to these barriers and then how

186
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,639
the monetization gets acquired

187
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,000
so each historian has its own thermal

188
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,639
critical barriers which evolve at the

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
time

190
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
which is worth noting and depending on

191
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
when they cross depends on the alignment

192
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,560
between the earth's feet or the

193
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
magnetization on the field

194
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,880
which affects the the mounted of the

195
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,160
remnants um also another thing to note

196
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,080
uh the last thing i'm going to say about

197
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
a slide is that uh

198
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
the earth's field or the um applied

199
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
field shifts these this part and the

200
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,160
thermal critical barriers

201
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
as you can see here by this ha um and

202
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,039
kind of in nature this is actually a

203
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,560
very small bias but i've just kind of

204
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,160
exaggerated it for this for the sake of

205
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,919
this schematic

206
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
so now i'm going to talk about how we

207
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
can use this model to look at grain

208
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,000
growth cm

209
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,639
acquisition so the start time um of com

210
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
acquisition

211
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,080
is when the particles are very small and

212
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
you can see that most of them

213
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
here's the price distribution most of

214
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,120
the histones are lying within the

215
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,479
superpower magnetic region

216
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
therefore they're not recording your

217
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,199
magnetic remnants

218
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,479
and then as the grains grow you can see

219
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,400
that the

220
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,680
the thermal critical curves are contract

221
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,199
contracting

222
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
and you can see that we're starting to

223
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
move into the remnants region and we're

224
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
starting to require a remnant

225
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
magnetization

226
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,080
and then at the final volume when the

227
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,280
grains are growing and when the histones

228
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,319
or you know when the

229
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,319
particles have reached their final

230
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,240
volume you can see that now the majority

231
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,280
of them lie within this remnants region

232
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,120
have acquired a magnetization and then

233
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,039
when we turn off the field this is our

234
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,599
final kind of magnetic remnants

235
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,960
you can see that it's um the

236
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
thermocritical curves are symmetrical

237
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,880
about the coercivity axis

238
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
and the histones which lie in this green

239
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,319
region are

240
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,000
contributing to the to the magnetic

241
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
remnants and if we sum up the

242
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,800
contribution of all of them

243
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,479
we get our crm so now i kind of talked

244
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,520
about how the model's built in fighting

245
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
space i'm gonna

246
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
kind of briefly um so an important part

247
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,520
of our model is the growth rate

248
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,520
so in a crm you know we're we're growing

249
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,879
our inner graduate crm that

250
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,400
the the particles are increasing in

251
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,599
volume kind of what rate should we be

252
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,599
building into our model

253
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,160
so we looked at the literature and a

254
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,319
recent study looking at pyrite fanboys

255
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
found that um they grew on the order of

256
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,520
order of days

257
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
obviously these are much larger than our

258
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,280
single domain

259
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,319
um particles or magnetotype grains that

260
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,160
we're interested in

261
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
but we get a growth rate um by using

262
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
this of about 10 to the minus 12 meters

263
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
per second as a radial growth rate

264
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,199
um and also if you look in the

265
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,240
literature further there's lots of

266
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,720
studies on like

267
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
growing microplate in the lab and they

268
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
found that single domain

269
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
magnetite grew on the orders of hours to

270
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
days which also gives um

271
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,959
very similar growth rates so that's the

272
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
growth that we use and we can

273
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,159
incorporate the growth rate into our

274
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,959
model in terms of an effective time

275
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,760
um which you derived which shows how the

276
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,959
how the

277
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,399
rate of growth affects how long the um

278
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,200
magnetization has to align with the

279
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,959
field at each volume step

280
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
so now i was kind of going to introduce

281
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,279
you to the outputs of the models

282
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,360
and the way the model works is we get

283
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,839
our final volume distribution from the

284
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,279
fork diagram of the pristine diagram

285
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
and then we we shrink these down to

286
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
nucleating and all of the grains have

287
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,320
the same growth rate

288
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,480
so therefore in order to get our

289
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
variation in volumes at the end we they

290
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,760
nuclear different times so

291
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,920
time equals zero in the model is when

292
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,440
the largest grain nucleates

293
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,440
and you can see that as you increase

294
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,920
time when we get to about 15 hours

295
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,839
um is this is when the majority of the

296
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
the particles are now nucleating and we

297
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,800
start to see a visible increase in the

298
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,000
mean radius

299
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,680
and then we actually have to wait until

300
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,080
about 22 hours until we get any

301
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
contribution to the to the magnetization

302
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
and this is because we have to wait

303
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
until these grains are growing through

304
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,080
the through the blocking volume

305
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
so as i mentioned we use literature to

306
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,399
look at the growth rate so we kind of

307
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
wanted to know

308
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,000
how does our model how does crms vary

309
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
with growth right and also

310
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,120
it's we also wanted to you know now

311
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,480
we're using our model to investigate the

312
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,640
properties of crms

313
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
so yeah so we looked at how crms how the

314
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
intensity changes with the growth rate

315
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,240
and what we find is that for for growth

316
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
times on the orders of hours

317
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
compared to growth times on the orders

318
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,240
of millions of years there's only about

319
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,399
a two percent

320
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
increase in the clm intensity so the

321
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,440
crms aren't particularly sensitive

322
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,120
to to the growth rate um and the other

323
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
thing that we we did is we can look at

324
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,839
how the serum intensity changed with the

325
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,839
applied field

326
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
and again as we saw in the um

327
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,279
experimental studies you get this linear

328
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
relationship and yeah clearly we see

329
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
this in our model

330
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
too and you can see here that um the

331
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,959
crms have all been normalized to the to

332
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
the saturation

333
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,240
isothermal monetization which we can

334
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,440
also um

335
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,800
model um using pisa space and

336
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
kind of now is a good time to mention

337
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,000
that we can make comparisons to trms by

338
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
using the

339
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
for the same price distributions by

340
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
using the trm acquisition model that my

341
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,360
supervisors developed back in 2011

342
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,959
um using 563 tlm acquisition you can see

343
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
here that they both increase at similar

344
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,120
rates um

345
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
so now i'm going to just talk about how

346
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,000
we can change the price distribution

347
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,519
to look at crm intensities and what we

348
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
find is that

349
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
so we can increase the amount of

350
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,200
interactions in a sample by

351
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
increasingly spread in the y axis of the

352
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,959
thought diagram

353
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
um of the prison diagram and we see that

354
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,200
as we increase interactions we get a

355
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
decrease

356
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
in the crm intensity this is because

357
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
when you

358
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,560
um increase the interactions you reduce

359
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,640
the alignment between the

360
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
um applied field and the histones

361
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,399
magnetization upon blocking so when they

362
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,360
cross those thermal critical curves

363
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,360
they don't align as as well so you get a

364
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
reduced magnetization

365
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,399
and the other way that we can vary the

366
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,640
price of distribution

367
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,800
is by changing the cohesivity so this is

368
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
the spread along the coefficient axis of

369
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
the

370
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,880
of the preset diagram and we can see

371
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,959
that as we increase the cohesivity we

372
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,680
decrease the intensity of the of the crm

373
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,120
so now so if i've looked at intensities

374
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,760
but we can also look at the

375
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,440
behavior of the crm um in response to

376
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
demagnetization so we can start to look

377
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,279
at the unblocking spectra

378
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,040
um and we can do this using thermal

379
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,600
demonetization or alternating

380
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
field demonetization by simulating these

381
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,000
processes again

382
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,440
in prison space for the samples um

383
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,760
for the for the crms that we've just

384
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
acquired and what we see here is that

385
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,560
when we

386
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,040
so the blue line is for this extreme

387
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,519
case of low interactions and the

388
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
green line is for the high interactions

389
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,959
and we see that we get a

390
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
we seem to get a slight increase in the

391
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,000
stability of the magnetization when we

392
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,519
increase interactions

393
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
but again you can kind of see my error

394
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
bars it's it's not particularly

395
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,160
significant in the minute and you know

396
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,200
we need to run on higher um

397
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,880
with higher number of histones and

398
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
higher resolutions to to really look at

399
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
this

400
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,800
um which i haven't quite had time to do

401
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,399
um

402
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,560
but yeah so this is kind of what we see

403
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
and we again can see the same thing in

404
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,720
the thermal d-max spectra

405
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,680
um again using the same particles and

406
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,040
they they um

407
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,800
they mirror each other quite well so

408
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,079
so far we've looked at crms we can come

409
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,440
we can make comparisons to the

410
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,440
unblocking spectra of

411
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,160
thermal demagnetizations compared to our

412
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,399
crms for the same price of distributions

413
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,279
so here for quite a high currency sample

414
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,680
with kind of medium to low interactions

415
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,440
we can see that the tm intensity is

416
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,760
higher than the crm which is which you

417
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,240
know

418
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,560
what we'd expect but the demonetization

419
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,680
spectra look quite similar in shape

420
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,959
um however when we go to loco acidity

421
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
samples so you know we're getting

422
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,880
towards the

423
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,760
the y-axis of the fork diagram we can

424
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
see that now

425
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
both of them were unblocking earlier but

426
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,399
also it seems like the

427
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,120
the difference between the serum the

428
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,720
tier may be a bit larger and the crms

429
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,959
are magnetically weaker than

430
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,800
than the terms in comparison it's also

431
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,600
worth noting that at this low cost

432
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,519
the crm intensity is more sensitive to

433
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,639
connectivity changes so now the tm and

434
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,320
the serum test are actually quite

435
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,079
similar in magnitude

436
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
but the demonetization spectras look

437
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,800
more different

438
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,560
um so kind of in summary

439
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
what we've looked at is we're developing

440
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
this model and i've kind of shown some

441
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
like preliminary results of what we've

442
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,399
seen

443
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
and we can see that crm intensity varies

444
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,760
significantly when we change the price

445
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,959
of distribution in terms of coercivity

446
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,480
and interactions

447
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,639
and both increasing the interactions and

448
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,880
the correctivity caused to this causes

449
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,800
or leads to this decrease in intensity

450
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,720
and we can see that the crm and tm

451
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
have different unblocking spectra and

452
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,399
they respond differently and

453
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,519
kind of um by different magnitudes to

454
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,760
changes in

455
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,120
in the price of distribution so kind of

456
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,639
what we're looking to do next is we're

457
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,000
going to apply this to experimental data

458
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,320
so we're going to use for diagrams that

459
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
have come from lab grown crms

460
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
and they've been acquired in the lab and

461
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
then looking at kind of what behavioral

462
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
model shows

463
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,720
but this was heavily delayed due to

464
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,760
covert but hopefully we'll be able to do

465
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
this soon

466
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
and thank you for listening and do you

467
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
have any questions

468
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:42,000
thank you so any questions

469
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,839
uh yeah i have fun um

470
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,519
that was a really great talk uh very

471
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,880
enjoyed that that was uh

472
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,880
really nice work i was going to ask

473
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,519
about so you showed one figure

474
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,279
which was the the the the drop off in

475
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,079
crm as you increase

476
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,120
these interactions it's quite quite

477
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
marked and

478
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,760
uh quite an important result i think um

479
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,000
how did how did that graph compare with

480
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,360
the

481
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,800
the equivalent trm i was wondering

482
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,000
yeah so the tlm also decreases with

483
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,199
interactions

484
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,519
and this is something that we're kind of

485
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,959
still investigating because um

486
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,800
it doesn't seem to be so they both both

487
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,760
the tlm and the crm obviously they both

488
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
decrease when we increase the

489
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,880
interactions

490
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,399
um but the the way that the ratio

491
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,680
changes we haven't quite constrained

492
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,720
because it does seem to change quite a

493
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,199
lot with the coercivity so the

494
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,920
cohesivity has a larger effect on the

495
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,199
crm to tlm ratio so i'm still kind of

496
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
looking into that but it looks like it

497
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,120
doesn't have

498
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,880
um there's a large effect um on the

499
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
ratio as they both decrease

500
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,639
so roughly similar amounts

501
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,480
yeah it seems like it but yeah thanks

502
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,160
yeah

503
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,160
so any any more questions

504
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,120
i've got one if if i can go ahead yeah

505
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,480
evie great talk um i know you mentioned

506
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,839
the beginning it had consequences for

507
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,399
understanding of early soil system

508
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
evolution

509
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,000
and it might be too early to sort of use

510
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
your results to

511
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to further that effort uh right now but

512
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
if you were to tentatively say

513
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,920
something right now certainly with

514
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,880
regards to sem acquisition during

515
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
aqueous alteration

516
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,759
uh during the early solstice do you have

517
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,959
any um initial observations there

518
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,440
um i don't think i could comment on that

519
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,959
yet

520
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,720
um i think it's something i'm really

521
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,920
interested in using like you know

522
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
when we kind of develop this model and

523
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,240
once you've applied it to experimental

524
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,720
data

525
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,079
then we can kind of think about how it

526
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,920
might affect that but i think at the

527
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,360
minute it's quite um

528
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,720
kind of just looked at kind of synthetic

529
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
samples so i don't think i can make a

530
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,519
comment but

531
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
it would be interesting to be able to

532
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,480
kind of model some acquisition for these

533
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
you know yeah because we think they're

534
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,639
really important in the solar system

535
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,639
stuff

536
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,320
it'd be really interesting and hopefully

537
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,600
um soon this model might be more helpful

538
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,040
at looking into that and

539
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,800
how they're affecting the remnants but i

540
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,880
don't think it's quite there yet

541
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,120
so i think i could comment on it awesome

542
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,880
thanks a lot

543
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,480
and that's why i'd like to go with it

544
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,399
but yeah

545
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,839
any any more questions so we have time

546
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,839
for a couple more

547
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,880
well i guess my other question is so

548
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,480
i mean you're modeling the prize at

549
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,439
distributions you'll show

550
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,000
this sort of nice ellipse of uh

551
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,559
where i mean if you look at rand what

552
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,480
the

553
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,160
shape of fault diagrams for um

554
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,520
interacting single domain they have to

555
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,080
have rather a different shape they have

556
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
this kind of more teardrop

557
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,760
shape i don't know if you've modeled

558
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,520
that and also when it comes to looking

559
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
at the solar system stuff that you know

560
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,919
like the

561
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
you look at ursula's poster which has

562
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
these framboids and plaquettes and

563
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
things like that and the fork diagrams

564
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,720
there

565
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
look uh again rather different to the to

566
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,160
the prize at distribution so is that is

567
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,200
that a direction you can go in to

568
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,160
to to model more realistic

569
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,960
uh prizette distributions yeah so

570
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,400
synthetically

571
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,919
we we kind of we're starting to look at

572
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,039
modeling these kind of tear duct shapes

573
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,559
that's something that i'm

574
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,640
kind of trying to model at the minute

575
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,039
but um kind of initially i've just been

576
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
kind of

577
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,559
using the ones that are kind of the

578
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,919
simplest cases basically kind of look at

579
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,840
the changes but um

580
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,440
yeah and we started to look at like um

581
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
kind of multi-domain shapes just kind of

582
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,200
investigating the parameter space really

583
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,720
um but yeah so it would be interesting

584
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,919
to be able to model more complex fort

585
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,200
diagrams but i think that's something

586
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
that will come with the experimental

587
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
data

588
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,280
so when we have experimental studies

589
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
then we'll be using real kind of thought

590
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,960
diagrams i think then we'll start to see

591
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,240
how they respond to these

592
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,520
these shapes and things so i think

593
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
that's kind of what i'm waiting on for

594
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,200
that mm-hmm

595
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,480
if i could just jump in i mean i was the

596
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
feeling was that when we were doing this

597
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
we should

598
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
we're just going to test the model on

599
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
some arbitrary forward distribution that

600
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
we should just choose some nice gaussian

601
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,919
distribution as a starting point and i

602
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,760
agree these are a bit artificial but

603
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,440
that was kind of deliberately

604
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
chosen because if we're just worried if

605
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,160
you chose you might end up choosing

606
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
something it's a nice single domain

607
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,520
sample and it's

608
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,799
not really in has a weird shape to the

609
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,240
fork diagram we're maybe

610
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,160
going down a rabbit hole so that's where

611
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:06,080
we stop these gaussian distributions to

612
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,080
start off with

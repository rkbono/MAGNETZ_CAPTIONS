1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,200
cool so thank you all

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,160
uh very much for um joining the magnet

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,320
seminars

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,679
and we've had quite a successful run and

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,599
today we've got another

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,880
uh popular session so it's really good

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,480
that we're getting

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,039
a lot of support for these so thank you

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,000
all very much for for coming

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,920
um just a brief reminder for the formats

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
of the seminars our talks are

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,640
about 25 minutes or so so could you

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,039
please keep your microphones muted

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
during the presentations was not to uh

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,360
disturb the

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,440
the presenter um after the the

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,559
presentation will have time for a 10 to

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,520
15 minute uh

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,719
question and answer session if you don't

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,000
want to

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,160
unmute and ask an oral question we can

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,280
read out any questions that are sent to

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,760
the text

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,320
and either myself or anita or one of the

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,120
other

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,039
co-hosts will read out the question for

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,640
you

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,480
and you know we've all got life going on

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
in the background so as always if you

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,960
have to go halfway through

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,799
please uh just go don't worry about it

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,920
um and at the end of the seminars we

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,479
will have um a chance to have a bit of a

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
social

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,640
a bit of a catch up with everybody um as

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,479
to make sure everyone's all doing good

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,960
in a bit of a friendly chit chat

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,600
um but that part of the seminar will not

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,880
be uh recorded

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
uh and so without further ado i will uh

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,520
hand over to

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,119
uh yael englert who is a phd student in

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,159
our lab in liverpool

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,079
and she will be talking about anomalous

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,600
field behavior in the south atlantic

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,880
over multi-million year

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,320
time skills so i'll pass over to you

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,439
y'all

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,439
yes thank you let me just share my

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,240
screen

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,200
can people see my screen right now yep

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,520
so you've got your

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
um powerpoint window

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
which is right in there

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,959
okay uh thank you for having me uh

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,879
i would like to talk to you today about

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,280
the recurrence of the magnetic field

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,840
anomalies in the south atlantic on a

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,840
multi-million year time scale for this

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
research we performed the paleomagnetic

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
study

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,040
at st tavena which we just

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,800
published in our paper in pnas

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,040
um the

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
st elena is the star in this image wait

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,760
let me just

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,560
switch to a laser pointer

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,720
everybody can see it and so in this

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,080
image of the field intensity

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,440
uh in from 2015 from igrf you can see

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,040
the blue star

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
being saint elena in the middle of the

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,280
south atlantic anomaly

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,959
and this talk is basically a short

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
overview of the information that is

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,120
given

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,480
in our paper and and yeah

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,720
we hope you'll read it afterwards

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
so the current field uh the current

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,120
medic field is not a perfect eyeball

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
and the weakest part of being the

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,599
southland economy

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,000
is a popular topic of discussion

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,200
at saint helena the field is also weaker

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,120
than expected it's about

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,599
29.1 microtesla

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
where if there was a two-centric actual

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,760
dipole

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
field we would expect the field to be

90
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,720
33.8 micro tesla

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
but actually at this island the

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,360
directional normally is

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,239
even larger with an uh

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200
inclination of minus 57 degrees where we

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,000
would expect

96
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,360
about -30 degrees if there was a

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
gadfield

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
um so to show this directional anomaly

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,560
we created this plot

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,599
showing a contour map of angular

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,920
deviation of the

102
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,599
present-day virtual geographic

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,280
geomagnetic poles to the

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,920
geographic bowl um and where you see

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
dark blue areas is where there's hardly

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
any

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
angular deviation or zero angular

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,680
deviation and then

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
where the colors get lighter or to

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,199
yellow and orange

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
there's a large angular deviation

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,720
between the virtual geometric pole

113
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,440
and the geographical and especially

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
the south atlantic anomaly is shown here

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,919
where there's a deviation over 20

116
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,240
degrees where st

117
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,240
lane is right in the center of that

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,639
so why is the size of land economy such

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
a popular topic

120
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,840
uh currently and why is it important

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
well obviously our

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
magnetic field protects us against solar

123
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,120
winds

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
and where the south atlantic economy is

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,520
there's less protection which is why our

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,440
satellites and international space

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,040
station actually get damaged and this is

128
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,639
a reason why nasa has been very

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
interested in tracking

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,360
the current behavior in the south

131
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,039
atlantic uh for us two physicists it's

132
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
more important to talk about

133
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
the features of the magnetic field and

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
how they are connected to lower most

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,639
mantle features

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,280
uh for instance john tarduno and others

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,919
presented this paper in 2015

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,320
um where they suggested that the edge of

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,280
the large low shear velocity province

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,840
uh coincides with this reverse flux

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,639
patch on the cormensal boundary

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,280
that possibly causes the south atlantic

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
anomalous

144
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,560
features uh here's the paper then

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,880
there's scientists who suggest that

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
the southland economy is a very recent

147
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
feature and

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
actually might be coinciding with the

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
total

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
drop of intensity of the field and

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,440
therefore might be

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
caused to believe that there's a

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,720
reversal coming up

154
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,720
and people suggest that if the south

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,440
atlantic region has been anomalous for a

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
long enough period of time it actually

157
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,199
defines the idea that our field averages

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,880
to a geocentric actual

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,080
dipole so many reasons

160
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,840
uh for scientists to publish so yeah

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,479
make many publications about south

162
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
atlantic

163
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,039
anomaly here's a couple of them from the

164
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,360
last five years or so

165
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,160
and then now our paper can proudly be

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,840
added to that list

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,360
um so i'm sorry

168
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,120
all these studies that i mentioned in a

169
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,080
previous slide except for our own

170
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,000
study uh the last 300 000 years either

171
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,000
with data or with models

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
but if you want to really make a

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,680
suggestion about the time average field

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and its connection to the

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,919
lowermost mantle features we would like

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
to discuss at least 10 million years

177
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,000
time skills

178
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,840
and saint elena comes in because the age

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
of the rocks from saint-elaina vary from

180
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,600
eight and a half to

181
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,039
eleven and a half million years uh

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,400
another helpful guide for us

183
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,240
is that the two years ago psv10

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,160
was published this paper about a

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
database for all the directional data

186
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,919
from the past 10 million years

187
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,000
which we used to compare our data to

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,960
which makes it possible to really

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
comment on the

190
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,440
field for the past 10 million years oh

191
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,000
um here is a data distribution for that

192
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
data set so the red dots are all the

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,360
paleo locations for

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,199
sites in the psv10 dataset

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
which is plotted again on this contour

196
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
map for angular deviation

197
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,680
that we showed before as you can see the

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,880
south atlantic and only

199
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,479
region doesn't have any data points

200
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,919
in psv10 um there is tristan bakunya an

201
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,160
island in the south atlantic

202
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,199
that does have so it's a green square

203
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,479
here

204
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,800
that um does have a paleomagnetic study

205
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,599
uh since then by shaw and others from

206
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
2016

207
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,599
uh which is not covered in pc10 and then

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
there's

209
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,800
saint elena which is even more important

210
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,919
because

211
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,520
uh tristan de cunha is only about 90 000

212
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,000
years old where saint elena comes in

213
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,440
with a very long time scale

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,280
so we went there uh january 2018

215
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,120
and the vegan and i went on field work

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,840
to saint elena which is uh

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,879
this beautiful island about 2 000

218
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,520
kilometers

219
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,280
left of the west coast of africa it's

220
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,919
about 122

221
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,720
square kilometers in surface and the

222
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,039
geology of st

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
elena is quite straightforward it

224
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,360
consists of two

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,520
shield volcanoes and one being the older

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,479
shield volcano

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,000
is exposed mainly in the northeast of

228
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,640
the island which you can see here on a

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,640
geological map so the red and orange

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,360
is the older is the exposure of the

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,599
older northeast volcano

232
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,440
the younger volcano is exposed in three

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,640
different shields

234
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,440
uh in these blue purple areas where

235
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,880
the upper shield is here where we

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
sampled

237
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,560
with the yellow squares and then the

238
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
main shield is in purple

239
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
and the lower shield is here in

240
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,040
turquoise

241
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,120
and the yellow uh symbols are where we

242
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,320
actually perform field work and as you

243
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
can see we sampled

244
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
all the different shields or times of

245
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
eruption so

246
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,320
we sampled the oldest northeast volcano

247
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,560
here in the banks valley area

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
where we took 10 sites and then the

249
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,959
youngest as i said

250
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,959
at prosperous bay it's called

251
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,200
then the main shield of the younger

252
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
volcano was trampled here at ladder hill

253
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,680
which was a very

254
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,240
very large section and we took 28 sites

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
from that section along a road cut and

256
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
then the

257
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,959
lower shield of the younger volcano we

258
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,920
took at two different locations

259
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,480
porches gate and sandy bay where both of

260
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,399
these locations had a dike intrusion

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,120
which we sampled to perform a baked

262
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,120
contact test

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,920
we sampled a lot in two weeks we took

264
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,279
over 50 sites

265
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,839
and 362 samples each site

266
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,200
generally represented a cooling unit or

267
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,160
a flow

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,360
and we sampled five samples minimum per

269
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,519
cooling unit

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
usually between five and ten samples per

271
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
site and

272
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
the flows varied in thickness from about

273
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,000
20 centimeters to

274
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,360
10 meters where possible due to exposure

275
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,800
uh we sampled the top the middle and the

276
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,560
bottom of the flow

277
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,839
and it was usually very obvious to see

278
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,079
where the flow began or

279
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,160
ended here are a few photos from our

280
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,279
fieldwork here in the top right photo

281
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,240
you see me

282
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,760
sampling at banks valley so the oldest

283
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,480
rocks of the island that we

284
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,519
took as you can see it's not the most

285
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,959
comfortable

286
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,399
sampling location it was quite steep and

287
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
we feared our lives a few times ah

288
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,800
that's exaggerated

289
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,640
here in the bottom left you can see the

290
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,519
youngest material that we took with us

291
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,120
aside from the bike intrusion so here's

292
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,800
prosperous bay and also one of the

293
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,880
thicker flows

294
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,079
and then here in the bottom right photo

295
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,640
you see andy

296
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,519
drilling in one of the dykes at sandy

297
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
bay so

298
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,200
in the younger volcano a dike intruded

299
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
which we sampled for a big contact test

300
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
which actually turned out to

301
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
be a lot less straightforward than we

302
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
imagined

303
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,279
and if i do have time at the end of the

304
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,240
presentation i prepared a few slides

305
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,320
about this

306
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,640
intriguing diet intrusion

307
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,920
so we demagnetized all of our samples

308
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,120
either thermally or

309
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
in an alternating field using a rapid 2d

310
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,839
magnetometer

311
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,200
or sorry or a jr6 spinner

312
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,680
and our results were very clear

313
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
all the directions were straight to the

314
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,480
origin

315
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,839
or if there was a larger overprints like

316
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,440
in this sample

317
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
uh the characteristic remnant

318
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
magnetization was still very clearly

319
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,959
interpretable

320
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
so overall our maximum angular

321
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,959
deviations were very low

322
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,120
if they did exceed 14 degrees we left

323
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,399
them out of the results

324
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,639
um the mean directions per site were

325
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,760
also very coherent so we

326
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,240
took a selection criteria of k over 50

327
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,480
and n equals over 5 and that left us

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,320
with 34 sites

329
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
and then we had two positive big contact

330
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,120
tests and a positive reversal test that

331
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
also

332
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,680
convinced us of the fallacy of our data

333
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,480
here is a summary

334
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,360
equal area plot of all of our sites

335
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,279
combined

336
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,000
and as you can see we both have reverse

337
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,639
and normal polarity in our sites

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,399
and you can see that there's many orange

339
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
sites which are from the latter hill

340
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
section that i mentioned before was a

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,399
very very large section in the

342
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
main shield of the younger volcano and

343
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,399
you see

344
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,160
uh a lot of green sites that have normal

345
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,279
clarity they are from the banks valley

346
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,839
section that was

347
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,560
in the oldest volcano and then you see

348
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
that uh

349
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,720
blue sites actually have some

350
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,839
transitional results

351
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,079
and this section showed us a reversal

352
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,639
where this is the bottom flow and it

353
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,320
goes

354
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,760
to the transitional flows and the top

355
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,040
flow actually has a normal

356
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,680
reversal and this is more

357
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,680
obviously uh clearly seen in this rough

358
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,560
magnetic polarity stratigraphy that we

359
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,880
created

360
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
where again you see all the sites here

361
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,440
all have a normal clarity from banks

362
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
valley

363
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
then the very large section in the main

364
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,160
shields

365
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,160
called ladder hill have three reversals

366
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,560
within that section

367
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,440
and then the youngest section prosperous

368
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,120
bay shows

369
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,920
a reversal in the actual results

370
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
and you can see that in our timeline we

371
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,959
have

372
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
we capture six different reversals which

373
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,440
is very reassuring of

374
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,279
our data set spanning a long enough time

375
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,839
timeline to say anything about secular

376
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
variation

377
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,560
when we plot our virtual geomagnetic

378
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,760
poles as we do here

379
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,480
after normalizing the reverse data and

380
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,120
we can yeah see a few notice a few

381
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,600
things

382
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,680
one the most important being that the

383
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
scatter of this data set is very very

384
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,600
high

385
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,399
so there's a lot of outliers um and yeah

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,440
the dispersion that we calculated is

387
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,120
21.9 degrees

388
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,040
which is very high for the latitude of

389
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320
saint elena i'll come back to that later

390
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
on

391
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,600
uh second thing is that even though

392
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
there's a lot of outliers and the

393
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
scatter is very high

394
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,480
the actual average of our data set isn't

395
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,519
that far

396
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,519
from the geographic pool so

397
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
even though we see a lot of anomalous

398
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,880
behavior

399
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,959
the actual average still gets close to a

400
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,600
geocentric actual dipole

401
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,880
which is reassuring for the paleo

402
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,040
mathematic

403
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,279
uh community so then we also plotted the

404
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,959
pool for the current situation so this

405
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,560
is the present-day field pool

406
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,560
for st elena which is noticeably uh not

407
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,880
much of an outlier compared to the rest

408
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,480
of our data from saint elena so although

409
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,320
in the current geomagnetic field

410
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,040
obviously the south atlantic

411
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,160
is uh showing very anomalous behavior

412
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,079
over time

413
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
the pull for the current situation isn't

414
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,920
an outlier for saint elena

415
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,920
compared to the rest of our data set

416
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,519
um so this 21.9 degrees vgp dispersion

417
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,480
that we calculated

418
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,399
um is very high for our last for our

419
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,399
latitudes but obviously we want to make

420
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,639
sure that it's not dependent on either

421
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,959
the fundamental cutoff that we used

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,839
or on the selection criteria that we use

423
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,199
like

424
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,480
in our case k being over 50 and n equal

425
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,320
or over 5.

426
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,560
so in this bar plot i present the other

427
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,560
scenarios that we tested and calculated

428
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,959
the vtp dispersion for

429
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,880
in all scenarios we use this equation to

430
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,440
calculate the vtp dispersion where we

431
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
also

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,560
accounted for the within sight

433
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,120
dispersion calculated from k

434
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,240
and in the bar plot you can see green

435
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
and blue

436
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,519
bars where the greens represent

437
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,160
scenarios where

438
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
we use the fundamental cutoff and the

439
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,800
blue

440
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,320
bars represent scenarios where we used a

441
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,240
45 degree cut off

442
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,880
and then the dark green is the scenario

443
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,279
where which is our preferred

444
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,480
selection criteria with k over 50 and n

445
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,519
equals over

446
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,279
equals or over five and then on the

447
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,160
right hand side of the plot you can see

448
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,000
all these

449
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,279
diagonal stripes through the bars which

450
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
represents that we

451
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,480
corrected for serial correlation how we

452
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,440
did that

453
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
is that we calculated uh over checks for

454
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,880
flows that were

455
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,360
right on top of each other and we

456
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,120
calculated or tested if they have a

457
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,720
common true mean direction

458
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,560
if they passed that commentary mean

459
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
direction test we

460
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,240
uh yeah took them as being serial

461
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,240
correlated so

462
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,079
uh deposited in such a short amount of

463
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
time that it captures only one moment of

464
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,279
the field

465
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
so we combined those two results and

466
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,759
then uh

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,519
took only one of the like the

468
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,639
combination into the

469
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,480
calculation for the vgp dispersion

470
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,480
so what you notice if you look at this

471
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,880
bar plot is that it does vary a little

472
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,800
bit our result is right here at 21.9

473
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,759
degrees and it goes down to

474
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,240
the lowest vgp dispersion is 18.4

475
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,600
degrees

476
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,480
is when we take k over 100

477
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,959
um and it goes up a little bit if we use

478
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,720
a 45 degree cutoff for instance

479
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,280
however even though it goes down all the

480
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,000
way to 18.4 degrees when we compare it

481
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,199
to

482
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,360
the predicted value at um

483
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,160
our paleo latitude of 19.8 degrees south

484
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,760
it is still uh statistically high so

485
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,840
here is a purple line or

486
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,039
pink line which represents the value for

487
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,360
model g

488
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,039
and to calculate basically the expected

489
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,080
ptp dispersion

490
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:45,120
at this latitude and multi is a

491
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,039
relation between latitude and vgp

492
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
dispersion in this case we took the

493
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,960
values for

494
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,799
a and b uh that are based on psv10

495
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,120
uh which are published by the ravine at

496
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:00,559
all in 2019

497
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,880
and i'll show you the model the

498
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,640
relation in the next plot as well where

499
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,400
we took all the data from

500
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,799
these v10 from the cromwell paper and

501
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
divided them into latitudinal bins of 10

502
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,160
degrees

503
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,280
but separated for the pacific hemisphere

504
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,240
in blue

505
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,160
and the atlantic hemisphere in green and

506
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,039
as you can see it follows the trend very

507
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,120
nicely

508
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,559
especially in the northern hemisphere

509
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,919
and again this trend is

510
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,000
uh mology but then our saint elena data

511
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,919
point right here the red star is

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,840
a massive outlier um

513
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,679
so and yeah that's the main thing to

514
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,520
take away from this plot really is that

515
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,640
just the vtp dispersion

516
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,320
at saint elaine is substantially higher

517
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,080
than expected at that latitude

518
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,360
and expected from the model g

519
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
calculations

520
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,720
then another thing to notice is that the

521
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,039
green bars

522
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
so the latitudinal bins from the

523
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,280
atlantic hemisphere

524
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,960
plot above this model g prediction a lot

525
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,320
more often than the blue

526
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,080
pacific bins so 64

527
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,440
of the atlantic bins plot above the

528
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,960
model g trend where

529
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,000
only 27 of pacific bins plot above this

530
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,640
trend

531
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,080
and another thing we noticed is that uh

532
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,080
like i said before

533
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,600
the data actually follows this model g

534
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
trend a lot better in the northern

535
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,919
hemisphere than in the southern

536
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,799
hemisphere

537
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,440
but that might be due to these bins uh

538
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,000
being

539
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,440
under samples which makes them under

540
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,440
represent secure variation

541
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,320
when we look at our ps v10 data set in

542
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,960
localities

543
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,799
instead of in latino bins st elena is

544
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,840
still an outlier it's again this red

545
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,000
star

546
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,600
um but there are a few other outliers as

547
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
well that don't follow the trend as

548
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,160
nicely and that weren't visible

549
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,039
in our previous plot the main one that

550
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,919
we want to

551
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,720
focus on is this outlier right here

552
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,840
which has a

553
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,240
vgp dispersion of over 25 degrees and

554
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,280
at that latitude again that is very very

555
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,919
high

556
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,559
so we looked at that beta point which is

557
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,720
um

558
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
the island of martinique which lies in

559
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,360
korean

560
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,559
and it's right next to the island of

561
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,600
guadalupe and they're only about 150

562
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,120
kilometers apart

563
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,440
and similar in age as well which makes

564
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
us

565
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,960
agree with the author of the

566
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,240
paleomagnetic study that was performed

567
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,880
at martinique

568
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,960
who say that the high secular variation

569
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,679
or the high gtp dispersion

570
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,039
from their data set is due to the low uh

571
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,159
amount of sites

572
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,280
that they sampled and not due to a low

573
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,799
to anomalous behavior in that location

574
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
because then obviously there would also

575
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,320
be very high vgp dispersion

576
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,960
at the island very close to it

577
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,960
and we can also show you the secular

578
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
variation or future dispersion assist on

579
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,880
the cunya which is the green square

580
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,919
here um which is as expected higher than

581
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
the trend

582
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,360
uh because it is in the south atlantic

583
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,799
um however it's a very young island and

584
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
therefore also

585
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,240
they didn't sample as long of a time

586
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
span as we did so that explains why it

587
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,080
isn't as

588
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,919
as much of an outlier as saint elena and

589
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,200
possibly also because it's a bit further

590
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,360
from the

591
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,159
center of the south atlantic economy

592
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,280
so um i think we've established that

593
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,120
there's a high

594
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,880
secular variation in the area around

595
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
saint helena but what causes this

596
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,640
anomalous region to

597
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,159
to have higher secular variation than

598
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
elsewhere on the globe

599
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,559
well there's many different theories and

600
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,919
as we mentioned before there's a theory

601
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:40,000
from john tarduno and others

602
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,559
that they suggest a large low shear

603
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,440
velocity province and its steep edge

604
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,720
causes a reverse flux patch on the core

605
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
mental boundary

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,840
possibly causing the anomalous behavior

607
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
and then there's other scientists who

608
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,520
suggest that their existence

609
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,760
of this eccentric gyre in the outer core

610
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,960
um which reaches the core mental

611
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,720
boundary at the

612
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,799
right under the atlantic is caused for

613
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,200
higher circular variations so

614
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,960
uh there's a paper by oberon others from

615
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,600
2013 who show

616
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,919
uh with numerical models what happens

617
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,640
when they put in this eccentric gyre

618
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,320
which

619
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,039
they say is eccentric due to the

620
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,919
asymmetric growth of the inner core

621
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,640
which then reaches the hormonal boundary

622
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,039
right

623
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
under the atlantic and in their models

624
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,240
this also causes

625
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
higher secular variation for the entire

626
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,799
atlantic hemisphere

627
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,480
which would agree with our conclusions

628
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,840
that we saw earlier

629
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,000
in the in the peace v10

630
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,880
relationship of v2p dispersion and

631
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,039
latitude

632
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,200
but it wouldn't necessarily explain the

633
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,480
extreme outlier that saint elena is on

634
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,120
that plot

635
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,320
so possibly it would be a combination of

636
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,039
both of these

637
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,039
scenarios

638
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,440
but the conclusions that we actually can

639
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,400
take out of our data set

640
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,080
out of our study is that vgp dispersion

641
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,919
for saint elena is

642
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
significantly high compared to the rest

643
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,880
of the globe for the last 10 million

644
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,080
years

645
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,120
which uh does support the existence of

646
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,039
an anomalous uh geomagnetic variations

647
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,039
and anomalous behavior in the south

648
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,640
atlantic for the past 12 million years

649
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,000
which is potentially linked

650
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,159
to the interactions across the

651
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,039
governmental boundary and the existence

652
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,799
of this

653
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,400
anomalous behavior for such a long time

654
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,600
scale makes the chance of it being

655
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,880
connected to the mantle

656
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,240
all the higher then we can say that our

657
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
mean pool our average

658
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,120
result uh actually isn't that far from

659
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,480
the geographic pole so it doesn't

660
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
necessarily

661
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,919
suggest that the time average field

662
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,880
columns reflect

663
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,039
a geocentric actual dipole and the fact

664
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,679
that we have a positive reversal test

665
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,159
agrees with that as well and the current

666
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
poll

667
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,039
for saint-elaine other current gp is

668
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,640
actually not an outlier compared to the

669
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,440
rest of the data from the past 12

670
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,919
million years at st toledo

671
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,360
um thank you very much that was my talk

672
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,240
well thank you very much jahl that was a

673
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,640
really good talk

674
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,480
i think we can all uh show our virtual

675
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,679
uh appreciation with our virtual round

676
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
of applause

677
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,799
um thank you very much that was really

678
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,919
good um

679
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:21,520
we can now open the the floor to to some

680
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,520
questions if anybody has some

681
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,799
there we go i can see lisa has uh elisa

682
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,640
talks has raised her hands

683
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,120
um if you'd like to unmute

684
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,559
yeah i had a couple questions um very

685
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,760
nice talk thank you

686
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,400
um yeah um

687
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,720
i i just was curious about two things

688
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,039
one is

689
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,919
that in the psv10 data collection

690
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:55,440
uh they uh or i should say we

691
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:58,799
collected for um plate motion

692
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,559
and um in because

693
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,320
over the last 10 million years if you

694
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,760
just restrict it to

695
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,840
a couple million years you don't have to

696
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,200
worry about it but

697
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:13,520
uh 10 million years you do

698
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,880
and um africa the african plate has been

699
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,000
moving northward

700
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,520
and it should be about a five degree

701
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,960
um correction for that from african

702
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
plate motion

703
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,679
um that's one thing so i was wondering

704
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,600
if you corrected for that

705
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:35,279
and the second thing is that uh ron shar

706
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,320
i'm sorry he didn't show up today uh he

707
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,760
he sho we published a paper recently

708
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,279
from the golan heights

709
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,279
and uh from from the levant

710
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:52,880
and he said which shocked me

711
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,520
uh that and but it's true if you use

712
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,720
tighter selection criteria like you're

713
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,760
mad of 15

714
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,799
is is very very loose

715
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,400
we always use five and

716
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,880
um he suggested that if you use an n of

717
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,159
six

718
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,400
and a cap of a hundred that the scatter

719
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,799
in our uh israeli data set

720
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,159
went way down and so we did the same

721
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,600
thing

722
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:25,200
in our reanalysis of the antarctic data

723
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,039
of lawrence and found the same effect um

724
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,960
and so i'm just curious how much

725
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,400
uh data scatter contributes to

726
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:40,159
your vgp scatter

727
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,480
okay so first the first question is uh

728
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,559
about the the movement of the plates

729
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,880
which we corrected for in the exact same

730
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,200
way

731
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,480
uh we basically copied it from p310 with

732
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,679
the nnr

733
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,080
marvel uh model that we used so it is

734
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,279
indeed

735
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,799
about six degrees even i think that

736
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,919
saint elena

737
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,960
moved um so the current latitude is

738
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,600
about 12 degrees

739
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,320
and we looked at the latitude which was

740
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,279
then was

741
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,080
about 19 degrees south okay so that's

742
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,039
the first thing

743
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,559
and then the second thing is uh yeah a

744
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,679
very important point

745
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,200
um i didn't actually look at the maximum

746
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,360
angular deviation

747
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,120
average for instance i think ours are

748
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,320
overall

749
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,440
lower than like a lot lower than 15

750
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,039
degrees

751
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,480
um so that would be interesting to see

752
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,799
what happens what is left

753
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,480
if you kick out more but i think it

754
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
would have a very small effect except

755
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,279
that your

756
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
end would then be a bit smaller if you

757
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,640
would have to

758
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,760
already small i mean you need a hundred

759
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,039
but

760
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,559
yeah and then um with the k value

761
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,840
obviously we did look at the

762
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,880
k over 100 situation which brings it

763
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,000
down to 18.4 degrees as i said in my

764
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,440
talk um

765
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,640
which is lower than 21 uh for the

766
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,000
4k over 50. but then yeah our n

767
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,600
value is only 19. so it's weighing the

768
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,679
ideas but i think the most important

769
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,720
thing is that 18.4 degrees would still

770
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,039
be statistically

771
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,919
a lot higher than than the expected

772
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,200
value

773
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,760
uh that we see from the trend that psv10

774
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,799
follows

775
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,039
and then i think if you would take our

776
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,480
data set and only look at what happens

777
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,799
with k over 100

778
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,320
you should reanalyze the psv10 data set

779
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,120
as well because maybe the whole trend

780
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,679
would then

781
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,360
absolutely i think so i probably have to

782
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,960
go

783
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,720
back to all these methods and do them

784
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,600
again and then yeah there's this

785
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,559
issue of not having enough yeah stamp

786
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,399
sites left and

787
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,840
it being quite difficult to go back to

788
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,840
saints elena especially current

789
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,039
situation together more but i think

790
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,440
i am definitely convinced that showing

791
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,520
that with k over 100 the

792
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,880
ptp dispersion is still statistically so

793
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,200
much higher

794
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
that there is something going on there

795
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,960
causing this high secular variation

796
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,559
yeah i think you're right i think your

797
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,720
instincts are correct

798
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:12,080
okay i do think we should go back to all

799
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,000
those islands

800
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,120
like an exercise and keeping keeping

801
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,039
ourselves on a job

802
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,919
you know i mean we prove this now but we

803
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,279
need to go back to get even more

804
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,640
a very good idea um so i think uh kathy

805
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,679
constable has a a question

806
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,360
uh in fact you're telling it yeah um

807
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,799
sorry first of all i've got a actually

808
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,640
i've got two questions

809
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,360
um my first question is actually about

810
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,640
numbers of data and uh whether you think

811
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,840
we really have enough

812
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,600
if you look at the psp 10 data set uh

813
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,399
there's a sort of there's an assumption

814
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,399
that the temporal sampling across all

815
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,440
these globally distributed sites

816
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,399
is somehow equivalent but we don't

817
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,760
really know that

818
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,720
for the past 10 million years and if you

819
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,240
look in the the 5 to 10 million year

820
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,279
older than 5 million year

821
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,320
interval you know there's a there's 166

822
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,360
sites in psv

823
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,799
10 and then if you correct for serial

824
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,159
correlation there are actually less than

825
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,399
a hundred

826
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,000
and so this is kind of a delicate issue

827
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,480
right because you're arguing that you

828
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,559
can

829
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,200
pick distinctions between ferran

830
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,760
fernando diranha and other places

831
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
and that in some cases you're arguing

832
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,200
that

833
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,960
small numbers of sites means you

834
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,480
overestimate the dispersion in other

835
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,080
cases as an argument that it

836
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,159
underestimates the dispersion and you

837
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,480
can't have it both ways

838
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,600
so the first question is you know are

839
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,279
there

840
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,360
how many sites do we really need in

841
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,880
order for you to be able to say this

842
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,000
and my second question well just get it

843
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
out there well

844
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,039
so you so you have a chance to forget it

845
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,600
is if you look at the um

846
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,279
south atlantic anomaly today there's a

847
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,760
significant low in

848
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,919
field and strength and so i'm wondering

849
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,519
if you have any hope at all of looking

850
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,519
at the paleo intensity

851
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:07,360
and uh using that to support the idea of

852
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,039
perhaps low intensity to support the

853
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,120
idea that there's a significant anomaly

854
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,240
there

855
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,039
and by the way it was a nice tool well

856
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
thank you

857
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,080
um the first question i find very very

858
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,480
hard

859
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,919
very difficult to answer because you're

860
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,840
right the data

861
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,919
is mainly focused on even the last

862
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,000
million year not so much

863
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,960
exactly specifically last five million

864
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,120
years um

865
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,799
so i think we could have a very lengthy

866
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,279
discussion with the entire community

867
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,919
about

868
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,960
what what is enough data and in the end

869
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,080
you do what you

870
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,919
do with what you have and i do think for

871
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,120
saint elena specifically we have enough

872
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,960
to show that

873
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,360
that is high sector variation um

874
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,360
and even i would say

875
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,399
that we could make that you know

876
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,200
comparison to

877
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,640
to the rest of the globe with psg 10 but

878
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,919
yeah we have to keep in mind that these

879
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,880
v10 might be

880
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,399
mainly actually ps35 plus a few extra

881
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,600
locations

882
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,640
um yeah i mean you if you look at the

883
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,799
distribution

884
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,559
for the older than five million years

885
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,399
it's you know it's like

886
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,600
i don't know eight or ten from

887
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,000
spitsbergen

888
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,720
uh less than ten from france uh you know

889
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,519
brandon

890
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,360
aren't a couple of from patagonia and

891
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,880
none of these are really large enough

892
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,000
samples to get a statistically

893
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
meaningful average

894
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,880
so you don't really know whether you've

895
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,320
got the contrast or whether it could

896
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,039
actually just be

897
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,440
that psv was overall very high at that

898
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,799
time

899
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,399
for example and that would be uh

900
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,159
that would also be an interesting result

901
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:46,080
would actually also be very interesting

902
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,760
yes um yeah i wouldn't know where that

903
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,159
boundary would be

904
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,760
exactly but i mean

905
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,440
i guess we'll just have to find a lot

906
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,360
more sampling locations that have

907
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,799
samples of older than 5 million years

908
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,200
and that

909
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,080
yeah in the south south southern

910
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,000
hemisphere specifically would be nice

911
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,840
and then your second question is yes we

912
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,880
are definitely working on gradient

913
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,200
density data

914
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,600
however uh currently the last four or

915
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,080
five months nothing has happened

916
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,360
so uh yeah hopefully very soon i can get

917
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,240
back to liverpool and

918
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,039
back to that we have some results but

919
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,960
it's very limited so far

920
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,159
and actually those are very varied as

921
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,600
well so

922
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,799
it's it's uh it's not yet good enough to

923
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,360
uh

924
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,200
share with the world yeah okay

925
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,279
thankfully i have time in the rest of my

926
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,919
phd before uh

927
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:44,960
yeah i'm done the covet situation

928
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,720
excellent thank you um do we have uh any

929
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,720
any other questions for y'all

930
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,399
oh we've got uh this might be a bit of a

931
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,919
plant but we've got a question from andy

932
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,159
biggin

933
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,840
hi um so yeah i'll do i'll just

934
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,679
weigh in on the as it's a comment really

935
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,279
just um we're talking about how many

936
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,159
samples you need so

937
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,079
can um i can't share my screen so i'm

938
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,040
looking at a plot now from a

939
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,399
monte carlo analysis that uh i published

940
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,200
in a 2008 paper

941
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,159
and basically yeah this is about right

942
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,399
though if you

943
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,200
the other 100 is ideal if you want to

944
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,079
get to

945
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,200
um you know dispersions that are likely

946
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,399
to be accurate to

947
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,639
to a couple of degrees uh but anything

948
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,560
sort of 25 up you should be down less

949
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,760
than five degrees sort of

950
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,760
out so on this on this level of

951
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,359
discrepancy that we have

952
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,119
a global data that's i would say that

953
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,399
we're kind of we're into getting into

954
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,079
safe territory there

955
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,280
so yeah i think you're in safe territory

956
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,879
the question is whether other people are

957
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,919
uh i would say below 25

958
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,760
yeah and certainly below uh 15

959
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,480
then you could be all over the place and

960
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,760
also to come back to what you said

961
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,280
um they can be both high and low

962
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,119
so there's no bias at least from this

963
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
from the simple analysis that i did that

964
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,000
they could be

965
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,720
for ten for an end of ten you can be you

966
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,079
know

967
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,960
easily up by uh uh yeah seven or eight

968
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,480
degrees or down by the same amount

969
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,720
i think what we're really saying is we

970
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,200
should re-analyze the psv10 data set but

971
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,200
then

972
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,880
instead of looking at localities with

973
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,560
minimum of nine we should look at

974
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,680
localities with a minimum of 15 to 20

975
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,240
let's see what's left and then you need

976
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,560
a

977
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,480
we need a taffy 2.0 where we get

978
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,480
actually what you need which is 100.

979
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,560
there's that's a lot of work so i'll see

980
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,760
you

981
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,760
the years nice

982
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:58,560
good excellent um we have time for

983
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:01,440
another question before we come so close

984
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,079
so i've got one last question um that is

985
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
uh

986
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,200
did you sample everything that's

987
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,119
available

988
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,880
or could you actually go back and get

989
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,240
more

990
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,160
um there is more available but we

991
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,680
definitely sampled the highest quality

992
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,280
flows that are

993
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,800
uh there then so for instance

994
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:26,000
ladder hill had like 50 sites

995
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,880
the ones that lived uh either you know

996
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,960
low quality or very altered or something

997
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,920
and then there's different outcrops that

998
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
are still uh available but like a

999
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,680
two-hour hike

1000
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,200
so we didn't have time and so we also

1001
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,560
don't know the quality because we never

1002
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,720
made it there

1003
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,400
uh so there is there is still

1004
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,440
opportunity it's just a matter of

1005
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,960
whether it's

1006
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,960
worth it then considering

1007
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
how far that travel is i would be up for

1008
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,400
it but

1009
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,800
right because they just need to be paid

1010
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,560
to go there

1011
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,560
one lava flow in yanmayan

1012
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,839
i think uh anita has another uh anita

1013
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,839
has a quick question

1014
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,839
sorry i wrote it in the chat sorry i was

1015
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,720
wondering y'all what's the

1016
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,599
what was the uh situation when you went

1017
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,839
there

1018
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,880
i see you have a already nice george

1019
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,240
grandma

1020
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,520
i was wondering about dating constraints

1021
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,320
they were already some dating done or

1022
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,680
did you do it

1023
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,920
oh and so the dates that we use

1024
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,599
for our study have been uh published by

1025
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,760
hanyu at on 2014

1026
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,839
so that is the most recent and that's

1027
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,640
the only argan iron dating that has been

1028
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,800
done

1029
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,920
uh but it's not the exact locations that

1030
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,480
we sampled

1031
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,640
some some are but most of them are from

1032
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,960
quite different location so we had to

1033
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,200
um either interpolate like between

1034
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,320
the this age that we knew that was

1035
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,359
younger and

1036
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,160
older um and then we are currently busy

1037
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,960
with uh

1038
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,079
another argan argon study and go out a

1039
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,280
collaboration of the

1040
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,280
scotland glasgow i think

1041
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,800
thanks cool excellent thank you very

1042
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,400

good uh presentation and

1047
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,839
um a very good uh question session

1048
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:34,880
um before we all

1049
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:37,680
um come to a complete close um

1050
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
i just like to to to remind everybody

1051
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,359

1052
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,920
um all of our magnets uh presentations

1053
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,680
are

1054
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,760
going up onto youtube it's a very long

1055
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,839
link there uh i'll send out a url to the

1056
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,800
um to the mailing list and i want to

thank the

1058
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
earthref and magic team for for hosting

1059
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,200
us um

1060
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,960
and for um setting up a system so that

1061
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,720
these presentations

1062
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,359
are citable uh objects um a reminder

1063
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,200
that we've got

1064
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,720
um our schedule uh for the next

1065
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,320
few weeks we've got most of it filled

1066
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,040
until the end of the year

1067
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,079
um we may have a slot uh available in

1068
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,320
december

1069
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,320
but i think that given that egu is

1070
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,359
looking up looking to basically take up

1071
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,560
the entirety of of december um we will

1072
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,760
probably not be

1073
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,920
hosting uh a seminar uh in december

1074
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,520
um but we'll be we'll be back uh

1075
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,400

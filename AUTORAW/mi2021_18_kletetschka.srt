1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,799
final talk of the

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,840
the session and it's by

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,480
gunter klitechka and the title is

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,599
magnetic interactions in the human brain

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,920
so

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
you can take it away and share your

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,080
screen

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,000
oh can everyone hear me yep

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,439
yep good and can everyone see the shirt

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
content

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
yep i can see it now

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,320
okay oh it's good to see you oh

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,520
everyone it's good to hear you it's good

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,559
to be

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,160
a little less isolated um so

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,200
here i want to present some applications

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
of magnetism

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,399
and biological human or medicine

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
research

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,399
robert basala who is a second author is

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,600
a medical doctor

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,680
that is working with me and because of

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,000
that we had access to

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,960
unique material and it looked like that

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,360
well we know the geometric fields are

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
there

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,600
and they interfere with the human brain

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,240
and we were just

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
studying uh the samples that we had on

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,320
hand and

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
found that not only there is magnetic

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,799
material

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,040
in the human brain but there is also a

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
way how this magnetic material can

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,200
interact with the synapses or with the

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,560
neurons

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,439
and so

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
here's uh what we find out well before i

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,920
proceed

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,720
on the left corner and right corner you

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
see

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,240
approximate size of our sample so you

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
can see they are all

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,479
roughly two centimeter by two

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,399
centimeters

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:59,360
cubes so let's also show the resolution

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,360
of the method that we use

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:11,360
okay let's see

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,520
the brains we got them from this

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,080
institute of forensic medicine

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,840
and there was also according to the

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,599
regulation and guidelines in czech

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,720
republic

54
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,720
so here is just uh an idea

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,959
how the samples were obtained

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,440
and how they were cut we used the

57
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,360
ceramic knife for cutting and we try to

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,640
use

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,920
the best way in order to

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,280
avoid any contamination

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
even though it when

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
when we obtain the final results and

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
we're comparing with some other

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
published data it

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
looked like the noise level of our data

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,879
were

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
quite high

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,400
but we are still confident that our data

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,120
show

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,480
gives us reasonable conclusions

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
here is an example of the typical

72
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:19,840
demagnetization of the

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,840
sample so the rb basically means right

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
like a right hemisphere but that's not

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
important the important thing is that

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
you can see that the noise level is

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,879
quite high and

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
uh the dimensions some of the different

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
it's quite

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,680
difficult to demagnetize these samples

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,519
using alternating

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,799
field up to 40 milli tesla

83
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,760
on the other hand when you when you

84
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640
saturate those samples and demagnetize

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,920
them

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,159
you can see that uh

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,120
the intersect of the two curves is quite

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,000
low which indicate that there is a

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
there is sort of negative interaction uh

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,879
in this system

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,439
and uh but you can also see that they

92
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,799
they're they are quite magnetizable that

93
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,000
the material

94
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,840
can and it's also quite

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,239
soft in terms of the following

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,239
demagnetization

97
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,600
uh here's the uh kind of a

98
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,919
complicated plot uh on the left

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,759
plot you can see the nrm of samples

100
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,000
and on the horizontal axis it's

101
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,880
saturation remnants

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,320
after you gave saturation in two tesla

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,000
fields

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,360
uh you can see that there's a like

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,720
different colors and red and yellow

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,680
are the are the brains that have

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,199
had a neurodegenerative disease while

108
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,120
the blue and greens

109
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,080
are without neurodegenerative disease

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
on this plot you can see that the red

111
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,919
and yellow

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,240
there they both uh indicated that

113
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,960
there's a larger or tendency to have a

114
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,080
larger

115
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,960
saturation remnants

116
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,479
while the nrm was about the same for all

117
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,000
the samples

118
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,960
the lines at the lower part of the

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,080
diagrams

120
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,800
are kind of a histogram of the data

121
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:26,080
so you can see how they were distributed

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,639
so uh maybe more to these samples the

123
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,639
b01 and b02

124
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,639
with the neurodegenerative disease and

125
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,000
b0 strain b04

126
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,360
e03 is an adult brain like a old

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,919
person and b04 is a child

128
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
brain meaning that we use it kind of

129
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,500
like a

130
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,579
control because we know that there was a

131
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,579
[Music]

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,600
it was a young and without any

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
iron accumulations as a result of age

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,319
because it's known that with age

135
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,880
the iron has a tendency to accumulate in

136
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,400
the human brain

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,560
on the right diagram i just

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,600
wanted to show the comparison of the

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,919
remnants

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
on the left diagram with the induced

141
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,240
magnetization

142
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,080
now here uh shown by magnetic

143
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,120
susceptibility

144
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,520
so the the labels are the

145
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,840
are dissimilar then red and yellow it's

146
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,639
a neurodegenerative disease and blue and

147
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
green

148
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,000
are the health brains and

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,240
so in here you can see that there's

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,720
there's a contrast that

151
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
in here in the remnants field the

152
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,800
disease brain has a large remnants

153
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,160
however

154
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,440
in for the susceptibility you can see

155
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
that the the red

156
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,599
one that had a large remnants has a very

157
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
low

158
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,880
magnetic susceptibility

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,160
compared to all the other samples

160
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,000
so uh so that was

161
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,360
uh so there was a question how to

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,280
resolve that uh

163
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,919
issue and we'll talk about a little bit

164
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,840
later

165
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
and the another interesting thing is

166
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,960
that since we

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,960
were able to get the oriented samples

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,080
in terms of the one brain we

169
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
were plotting the magnetic directions

170
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
and

171
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,720
find out that the magnetic directions

172
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,440
are from the

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
from the oh from the forehead to the

174
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,440
back

175
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,039
of your head and so we were

176
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,319
kind of curious why is that why a human

177
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,280
would have a magnetized brain from

178
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,440
forehead towards the back of your head

179
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,319
and

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
the the the other brain did not show

181
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,199
that the other brain had

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,319
more like a shotgun distribution of the

183
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,199
magnetic directions and so

184
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,560
the then we find out that this specific

185
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,319
person

186
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,479
spent the last three years in a bed

187
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
because it was an urgery person and

188
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,560
could not move so

189
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,879
she was just spending the whole

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
three years in a lying horizontal

191
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,840
position and in terms of the

192
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,879
magnetic field in a region

193
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,400
here in central europe in prague

194
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
the magnetic field is small it's a

195
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,599
vertical and so it

196
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,760
started to make sense why the

197
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,680
brain would get the magnetization

198
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
from the forehead to the back side of

199
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,479
your brain because as the

200
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,880
during the during the final progression

201
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,200
of the disease the last three years

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,959
and there was a growth of the or

203
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
magnetic mineralization

204
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,120
these grains would get the chemical

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,200
remnant magnetization

206
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:01,600
and it will be recorded from the

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,519
overhead to the back side of your head

208
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
this side the diagram on your right

209
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,080
shows the stability

210
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,800
since most of these uh magnetic

211
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,120
mineralization and brain are

212
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,080
super paramagnetic uh there is a

213
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,640
you know there is a the signal has it's

214
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
not

215
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,839
very stable as soon as you measure

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,959
the saturation remnants you can see

217
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,240
there's a decay in terms of the second

218
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,920
as as because of the low

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,360
stability of the magnetic range as a

220
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,519
function of time

221
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,800
we also obtained data of

222
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,000
of zinc and calcium that

223
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,519
kind of related to the disease

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,880
and also the iron concentration

225
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,240
of those samples and we'll

226
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,480
talk about it a little bit later

227
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
this diagram is a little bit more

228
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
complicated

229
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,680
but let me just try to quickly uh jump

230
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
into it i mean

231
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,839
there's a brain there's a neural cell

232
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,519
and so this diagram

233
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
right in the middle it's basically the

234
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,720
interior of the neuron

235
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,519
and of course there is an iron which is

236
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
kind of a

237
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,600
trying to be stable on a on the equal

238
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,640
level and so there are

239
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,839
there is a there is a one door or one

240
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,920
opening

241
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,160
there are openings where the iron gets

242
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
in there are also other openings where

243
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,800
the iron gets out and of course there

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,800
are mechanisms that are trying to keep

245
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,040
the iron concentration

246
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
about at the same level and of course if

247
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,160
there is a

248
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
reason for a higher concentration of

249
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
iron

250
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,480
then uh there is a mechanism that kind

251
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,120
of try to precipitate the iron in

252
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,720
some kind of a solid matter so it's not

253
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,399
in a liquid state

254
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,839
and so one observation that was

255
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,040
reported is that on these doorways when

256
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
iron goes in and out very often like a

257
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
zinc

258
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
uh plays a role that it can actually

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,839
block

260
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,120
the the entering of the door

261
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,880
and this would cost or or

262
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
exit of the door and this would cause

263
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,440
the mineralization and

264
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,480
so we showed this uh

265
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,839
hypothesis that once you get this

266
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
uh like a magnetic brains or

267
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,320
mineralization that

268
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,519
because these particles are super

269
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
paramagnetic

270
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
the their magnetic dipole is oscillating

271
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,640
like

272
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,160
randomly and as a result of this

273
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,560
oscillation because around

274
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
all this material all this liquid is a

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
conductor

276
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,680
you would be inducing the electric

277
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,640
currents that would have the similar

278
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,360
frequency

279
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,000
as the frequency of the of the rotation

280
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,480
of this

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,480
dipole because it's a superpower and

282
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,760
magnetic grain

283
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,639
and so the general model uh

284
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,160
suggests that uh you know when you are

285
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,720
born i mean you have some

286
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
like a mineralization in your brain

287
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,279
which uh

288
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,120
as a which i mean is keeping

289
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,200
its its size small or super magnetic

290
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
however when when this mineralization

291
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,959
when those grains get bigger

292
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,000
uh you are slowing down this oscillation

293
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,920
of the magnetic dipole inside this

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,959
magnetic particles and as a result of it

295
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,880
you have this

296
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,360
like a different electric

297
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,880
variation or the electric currents that

298
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,680
has an alternating

299
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,320
current that may interfere with the

300
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
neural

301
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
synapses and because we know that the

302
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,839
neural synapses are operating

303
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,399
approximately as like a tensile hertz

304
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,240
frequency as soon as you were to

305
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,279
increase the size of these

306
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,040
minerals that the size were the

307
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,680
frequency of the oscillation would be

308
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
about

309
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,440
20 50 10 hertz

310
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
you would have a way to interfere with

311
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,680
the

312
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,959
synapses electro electric uh

313
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,839
electric uh pulses

314
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,040
so this is the hypothesis that we are

315
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,920
following as a

316
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:27,440
result we also try to

317
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,720
try to like modify the

318
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,519
nil theory or adjust it to you know to

319
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,040
get some kind of

320
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,240
handle on understanding how this crm

321
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,160
because the this theory was

322
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,959
written for trm so we have a crm

323
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,639
substituted instead of trm in this

324
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,240
tangent hyperbolic function

325
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,600
and of course we are using blocking

326
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,079
volume instead of the

327
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
blocking temperature and then we follow

328
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,440
basically

329
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,199
we also use this time scale because we

330
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
also would like to have a handle on the

331
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,040
time

332
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,120
how quickly the magnetic vector of a

333
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,240
single domain particle oscillate

334
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,079
and once we put it together

335
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,279
we assume that the crm and saturation

336
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,199
remnants

337
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,959
in those individual particles are the

338
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,839
same so we have one

339
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,040
and then when we have a argument of this

340
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,560
tangent of

341
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,199
hyperbolic angle we know that for

342
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
for everything greater than 2 this is

343
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
this is

344
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,279
correct equation so we basically

345
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,519
say that once the argument is equal to

346
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,320
two we have a like a simple

347
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,839
uh or simplification that kind of could

348
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,199
give us a handle

349
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,480
about how much field you would

350
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,560
require for in order to

351
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,279
to stabilize the particle that has a

352
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,160
certain core acidity

353
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,519
so this kind of like a preliminary like

354
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,079
a

355
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:04,560
idea how it may work and

356
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:07,440
then we also try to get the handle on

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,639
frequency dependence measurements and we

358
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,639
show that there is a

359
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,959
lower susceptibility with the higher

360
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,680
frequency which is

361
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,480
which is confirming that we are dealing

362
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,120
mostly with

363
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:26,160
super uh paramagnetic grains

364
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,120
and this uh comes to the conclusions

365
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,360
uh that we made from this study that uh

366
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,519
we think that this non-nominalization

367
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,399
uh correlates with the neurodegenerative

368
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,040
diseases and you could you could monitor

369
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,680
it by

370
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,199
motor monitoring the magnetic remnants

371
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
because as soon as you have a magnetic

372
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,880
remanence presence

373
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
then you know that the magnetic

374
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,720
particles grew to the size

375
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
where they already have a they are so

376
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,120
large

377
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,600
so they could record the remnants

378
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,480
however before they reach that that

379
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,519
grain size

380
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,120
there is this electric noise which

381
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,079
relates to the electric uh frequencies

382
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,519
that are operating

383
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,399
in a human brain and so we think that

384
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
this transition

385
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,399
between super paramagnetic and like a

386
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,600
particle with the remnants is important

387
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,279
in terms of the electric noise in your

388
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,279
brain

389
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,600
we have some reason to think that zinc

390
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,440
may interrupting the iron pathways and

391
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,440
this may be the way how you could

392
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:41,600
start to induce the mineralization

393
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,839
in the human brain and

394
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
we have observation that both low and

395
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,480
high magnetic susceptibility

396
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,360
occurs in the brain with

397
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,440
neurodegenerative disease

398
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
and we interpret this that this has to

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,880
do with

400
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,440
once you change magnetic particles

401
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,920
from super paramagnetic single domain

402
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,279
the

403
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,360
magnetic sustainability is sharply

404
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,799
like a decreasing for these drains and

405
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,360
that may be the reason

406
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:14,079
for this observation and

407
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,720
and so we think that we also offer like

408
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
a

409
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
different mechanism for electric

410
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,240
interference of these

411
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,120
magnetic nanoparticles and with this

412
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,600
i i'm opening if anyone has any

413
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,600
questions

414
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,280
so thank you guter for your talk so do

415
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
we have any questions

416
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,039
i go in sir i'll i'll just jump in with

417
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,320
a a quick question that's a really

418
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,240
interesting talk

419
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,400
um so these these uh nano particles

420
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,480
um are they fixed within the brain or

421
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,600
are they free to move

422
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,480
uh within within the space

423
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,520
uh hang on let me let i have some

424
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,000
trouble

425
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,919
finding out where where is my zoom hang

426
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,620
on

427
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,200
into

428
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:09,120
[Music]

429
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,480
oh okay i see you now

430
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,440
okay uh say can you repeat the question

431
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,400
i was a little bit

432
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,240
so are the nanoparticles um fixed within

433
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,840
the brain structure or are they

434
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,480
um free to move

435
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,000
well it's a good question they are in in

436
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,160
this neural cells and

437
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,320
because there are is on the order of

438
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,760
like uh the units the tenths of

439
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,720
nanometers

440
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
uh the question is if they would be if

441
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
this

442
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,559
specific metallation would be occurring

443
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,799
on us on a like a

444
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,240
membrane because once they would be on a

445
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,880
membrane they would be more or less

446
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
stuck

447
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,240
or if they would be like in a medium

448
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,760
where you have this flow of the fluid

449
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,760
because we had this observation of this

450
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,760
remnants in terms of from the forehead

451
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,320
to the back side

452
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,120
it looked like that these nanoparticles

453
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
would have to be

454
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,559
stuck somewhere along the wall of the

455
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,799
neural

456
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,559
cell i guess if if they are

457
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,200
free-flowing as well then the the

458
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,880
effects of brownian motion would also be

459
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,880
producing eddy currents

460
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,720
well what you are

461
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,000
you mentioned brown in motion which is

462
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,039
basically something which is

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,400
causing the destabilization of the

464
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,600
magnetic remnants right it's a common

465
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
vibration

466
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,640
yes i'm curious about as to whether or

467
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,320
not

468
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,559
you know some of your calculations if

469
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,760
you've considered that for a free moving

470
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,240
particle

471
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,440
a brownian motion will induce rotation

472
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,080
of the particle

473
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,280
um which will actually create its own

474
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
eddy currents because you have

475
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,039
these two two mechanisms of the

476
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,799
superpower magnetic flipping

477
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,400
but also the the physical rotation of

478
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,640
the particle at the same

479
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,200
time which might also contribute to the

480
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,440
production of eddy currents

481
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,039
that's a very good question i i didn't i

482
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
didn't think of the

483
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,880
specific moving of the particle i was

484
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,039
assuming almost

485
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,159
all the time that there is a just

486
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,320
particle which is

487
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,919
not moving but the magnetic dipole is

488
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
moving as a result of the

489
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,559
phonon vibration but what you are saying

490
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,640
is it's correct it could also have a

491
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,159
effect but i didn't think of it thank

492
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:28,400
you really really interesting study

493
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,400
cheers do you have any more questions

494
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,840
there are some questions in the chat

495
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
okay yeah

496
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,159
that's it i think anita wants to know

497
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,640
how to store

498
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,640
a brain

499
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,480
yeah okay so this

500
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,320
is a there's a question in the chat

501
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,919
there's a there's a fluid uh

502
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,360
it's called formally you know

503
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,559
formaldehyde

504
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,559
uh which uh these you because

505
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,880
normally if you don't if you don't put

506
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,039
it into this fluid it's very difficult

507
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,039
to

508
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,240
handle the brain it's kind of like

509
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
really like a

510
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,200
smooshy but once you put it in

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,799
formaldehyde it become more like a tofu

512
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,600
tofu the japanese tofu right so it's

513
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,080
it's then you can work with it quite

514
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
easily

515
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,480
yes sorry if i intervene yes this is

516
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,559
what i was asking because

517
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,600
uh actually um i was seeing this process

518
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,919
happening i was

519
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,640
i didn't directly measure those samples

520
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,000
but

521
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,000
uh so i observed that if you if they are

522
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,520
stored in the formal diet they

523
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,440
basically provoke an artificial kind of

524
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
decrease of the magnetization of the

525
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,280
sample which is already

526
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
very very weak as you showed so and also

527
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,000
the

528
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,000
the contamination of the room where it's

529
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,039
kind of prepared the samples that also

530
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,520
affect a lot so

531
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,960
if you put air filters in the in the

532
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,880
room you'll see how big that

533
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,480
contamination it is so that's why i was

534
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,840
asking about the preparation of those

535
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,600
samples because i

536
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,679
it's a very good question and there

537
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,799
there was a study

538
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,840
on her brain uh

539
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,240
about three years ago uh where i was

540
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,000
observing our data with that data

541
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,799
and i could see that their ability to

542
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
detect

543
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,559
and report uh like some of the magnetic

544
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,760
remnants signature although samples that

545
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,919
were very weak

546
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,679
were almost like an order of magnitude

547
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,480
lower than ours

548
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,480
so because i could see that once i was

549
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,400
trying to handle the magnetizations

550
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
that were reported in that study i could

551
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
see that

552
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,919
it's all noise that i could not really

553
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,919
rely

554
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:53,120
rely on on that data so i was not

555
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,280
including those data in because i i

556
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,679
thought maybe

557
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,880
we did not have as pretty pristine

558
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,559
procedure

559
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,880
we didn't do like uh we didn't

560
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,640
have any like a hepa filters when we

561
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,679
were i mean we were doing in a

562
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,480
in a that hepa filter in it but still i

563
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,080
think there is

564
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
some space for contamination

565
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,919
thank you

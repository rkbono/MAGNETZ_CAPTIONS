1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,879
great uh next talk uh

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,200
coming from yale and yale n

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,519
bears uh uh on recurring magnetic field

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,759
anomalies in the south atlantic and the

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,240
first paleo intensities are from saint

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,240
helena

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:31,840
yeah let me just share my screen

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
can everybody hear me yeah and we can

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,280
see your screen as well

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,000
awesome and my pointer

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,399
everything ready um so thank you my name

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,600
is yael ingers

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,840
and i want to discuss um the south

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
atlantic anomaly or the recurrence

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
of south of irregular behavior in the

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,160
field in the south atlantic

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
and with that the first paleo intensity

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
is coming from saint elena which is the

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,280
blue star

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,799
on this global field strength uh figure

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,880
um see so first a little

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
recap of today's magnetic field which is

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,640
not a perfect dipole

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
in this figure you can see the field

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,040
strength from igrf-12 from 2015

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,720
where you can clearly see a weakness in

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,000
the south atlantic which we

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,280
call the south atlantic anomaly and

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,200
this anomaly leads to irregular uh

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,680
behavior at st helena which is this blue

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
star where for instance the declination

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,479
is almost 17 degrees off

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and the intensity is 29 micro tesla

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,640
where we would expect

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
almost 34 micro tests left for a gad

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
field

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,640
so a dipole field

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
why is this uh anomalous feature so

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
important

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,840
and talked about so often uh well for

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,640
instance our satellites get

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,920
um get damaged because the magnetic

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,520
field doesn't protect them

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,079
as well as they should in the south

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
atlantic but for us geophysicists and

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,840
geologists it's more important to

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
discuss the link between the anomalous

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,399
behavior of the field

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,440
and the lower most mental features uh

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,720
which was done by

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
john tradino in 2015 uh tardino and

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
others

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
published data and new data from south

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
africa saying that the south atlantic

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,680
anomaly was longer lived

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,160
than thought before and they linked it

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,959
to

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,599
the steep edge of this uh large low

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,879
shear velocity province or lsvp

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,760
under south under africa which they

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,160
say causes this the first flux patch in

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,239
the

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,080
field on the core mental boundary then

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,280
causing the south atlantic anomaly or

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,680
anomalous features in the field

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
other study studies suggest that the

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
southland anomaly and the overall

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
weakening of the field might

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
be a precursor of the whole field

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,760
reversing which obviously is also very

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
interesting

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
to all geologists and especially

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,400
paleomontists

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,560
um and if this atlantic

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,480
uh irregular behavior is actually very

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,040
long-lived feature does it

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,080
interfere with the hypothesis hypothesis

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,159
of a geocentral actual dipole

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
um these are some reasons of the many

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,519
publications that came out in the last

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,560
couple of years

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,280
uh showing here with for my personal

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
highlight

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,799
our paper this summer uh in pnas with

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,480
the directional data from saint elena

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
uh saying that in fact there was

87
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
irregular behavior in the south atlantic

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,120
on a million-year time scale when

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,879
looking at directions from saint helena

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,480
so why do we look at saint-elaine now

91
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,519
all these other studies that i showed in

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,480
the previous slide

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,560
talk about last 300 000 years maximum

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,959
but when we talk about timer rich field

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,120
we

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,640
preferably want to look at at least 10

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
million years

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
which is also why we looked at this data

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
set

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,920
that was published by cromwell and

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
others um in 2018

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
discussing all the paleo secular

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,080
variation data from the past 10 million

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
years

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
which we used to compare our direction

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,680
from

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,200
directions from saint-elaina with uh and

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,400
saint-elaine is

109
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,840
a volcanic island that has rocks

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,040
from between the ages of eight and a

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,760
half and 11 million years old

112
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,919
so a quick recap of uh the directional

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,280
study that we published this summer

114
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,759
um we performed directional uh

115
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,520
paleo directions on about 50 sites and

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,120
here are all the results in this equal

117
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
area plot

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
which we then turned into virtual

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,440
geomagnetic poles

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,440
and those virtual geometric pools were

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
uh quite scattered even though they

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,600
averaged out

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,520
to this uh pool that comes quite close

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
to the geographical the dispersion is

125
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,199
very high

126
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,600
which is 21.9 degrees which we then

127
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,160
compared to all the other data

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
in this plot in from psv10 so that's 10

129
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
million year old

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,759
at 10 million year database and where

131
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,400
this red star

132
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,320
is our dispersion from saint elena which

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
clearly is an outlier and doesn't follow

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,960
this

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,600
beautiful trend that shows the

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,240
latitudinal dependence of the dispersion

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,360
so with that we said the irregular field

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
in the south atlantic

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
is actually occurring on a million-year

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,360
time scale

141
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,039
based on these directions um but now we

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,639
want to talk about the paleo intensities

143
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,960
from the same island

144
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
so first we go back to this island where

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
we went on field work

146
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,880
andy bigen and i in january 2018.

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,800
uh it's beautiful island which is

148
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
circled here on this map it's about 2

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,759
000 kilometers west of africa

150
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,520
about 122 square kilometers in surface

151
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,440
the geology of st lane is rather

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,759
straightforward it's a volcanic island

153
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,919
that consists of two shield volcanoes

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,880
the red and orange in this little plot

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,520
uh show the older northeast volcano

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,520
and the blue purple colors showed a

157
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,600
younger southwest volcano

158
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
that consists of three different shields

159
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
a lower shield

160
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,960
middle shield and an upper shield and

161
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,759
which we all sampled

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,039
in all these yellow spots where we

163
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,479
gathered

164
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,840
lava flows we sampled over 50 sites

165
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
uh usually about five to ten samples per

166
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,479
site

167
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,639
and the flow thickness varied from about

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,759
20 centimeters to 10 meters

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,520
and where possible we sampled the bottom

170
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,080
middle and top of the flow

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,759
so before we dove into the paleo

172
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
intensity experiments we performed rock

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,000
magnetic experiments

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,199
we created susceptibility curves uh on

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,440
the copper bridge

176
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,880
we performed experiments on the vfdb

177
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,319
creating hysteresis loops

178
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,600
and irm plots and we perform vrm

179
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,680
experiments

180
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
here i'm showing uh the susceptibility

181
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,479
curves from all the

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,919
successful sites and you can see that

183
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
even within all these

184
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,039
sites that actually gave more than three

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
uh

186
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,720
three or more petty intensity results

187
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
the susceptibility

188
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,520
curves give very varying uh

189
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,560
ideas of the rock mag within

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,199
saint helena

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
yeah that already gave us not the best

192
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
hope

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,479
for paleo intensity results and they are

194
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,800
actually quite hard to get

195
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,280
so we so far only performed pillion

196
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,680
intensity experiments on two localities

197
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,919
one from the mid shield of the younger

198
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,479
volcano ladder hill

199
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,960
uh and one from the older volcano banks

200
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,479
valley

201
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,240
that's the abbreviations are lh and pv

202
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,520
which is handy for the

203
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,919
upcoming slides and we performed uh

204
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,639
thermal izzy talia and microwave is

205
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,199
italian

206
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,560
and here's an overview of the selection

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
criteria that i use

208
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
for the brilliant intensity experiments

209
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
um

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,479
that we can that uh i'm showing later on

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,479
as well

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
so let's start with the good results or

213
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,160
okayish results here already arrived

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
plots from samples that

215
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,520
uh passed quite clearly our

216
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,680
selection criteria some are very

217
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,720
straight lines beautiful right plots

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,879
no viscous overprint and no alteration

219
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,599
or hardly any alteration

220
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
um then there are some plots with a

221
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,680
little bit of a too sloppy behavior but

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,120
from the zeitgeist plots it becomes

223
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
quite obvious that it is

224
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,479
uh this is a viscous overprint that

225
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
we're dealing with

226
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,400
um so yeah there's definitely some

227
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,400
results that i'm happy with

228
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,160
and when you look at the actual

229
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,199
intensities that they produce they are

230
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,800
all relatively low or very very low like

231
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
this five micro tesla

232
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
eight micro tesla and the highest in

233
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,640
this plot

234
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,560
and you know uh most of them is 23 micro

235
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,519
tesla where the field at saint elena

236
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,880
today

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,560
is 29 micro tesla

238
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,480
so we also have a lot of very bad

239
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,279
results that i thought i would throw in

240
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,360
there

241
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,360
uh yeah almost laughable

242
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,560
sad but let's move on quickly to the

243
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,240
more interesting results

244
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,480
or the ugly results as michael

245
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,519
introduced them

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,120
these are results that

247
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,279
look like they shouldn't pass selection

248
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,399
criteria but they do

249
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,959
like this ladder hill 10 site which

250
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,320
shows very zigzagged results

251
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,800
but does pass all the selection criteria

252
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
in this case we think that this is due

253
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
to the big difference between the lab

254
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
field

255
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,640
of 20 micro tesla and the ancient field

256
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
that is producing

257
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,839
4.7 micro tesla and we were right when

258
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
we

259
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,240
reproduced the same uh experiments but

260
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
with a lower lap field of 10 micro tesla

261
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,360
we got the same results

262
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,000
but with a more beautiful um

263
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
beside a right plot which is shown in

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,440
this

265
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,560
figure two slides back um

266
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,839
but the most problematic sites

267
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,200
are lh6 and lh13 which show very

268
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,480
two-slope

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,880
uh behavior very strong to slow behavior

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
and for instance in this case you could

271
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
argue

272
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
because of the zeita felt plot that this

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,920
is due to a viscous overprint

274
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,000
but in some cases the actual steep slope

275
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,279
passes the selection criteria like here

276
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
on the right

277
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,800
and which produces a field of 87

278
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
microtesla

279
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
which is problematic to say the least

280
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,560
considering the others

281
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,320
samples produce a field of 10 or 20

282
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,880
micro tesla

283
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,000
um so yeah this is the case for lh6 and

284
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,279
lh-13

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,560
and uh we're wondering if this is due to

286
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,519
md particles multi-domain particles um

287
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
order because of uh viscous overprints

288
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
so

289
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,920
we need to do more experiments and add

290
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,480
ptrm tilt checks

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
to our experiments uh the microwave

292
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,600
samples also don't show this

293
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,279
uh so hopefully we can also create some

294
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
more microwave experiments however the

295
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,000
microwave is broken

296
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,720
at the moment um so for now i've chosen

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,519
to

298
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
include all the all the samples all the

299
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,880
results

300
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,240
that pass the selection criteria if i

301
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,720
make the selection criteria

302
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,880
stricter i don't actually lose these and

303
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,360
i do lose some of the values that i do

304
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,959
trust

305
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,279
so that is not a solution unfortunately

306
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,440
um here is an overview of the eight

307
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,480
sites that we have so far that have

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,959
uh paleo intensities with an n

309
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,880
of three or higher and then you can

310
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,839
immediately see that there's

311
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,240
two sites with the too slow behavior

312
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
that

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
sometimes give a very high intensity and

314
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,959
sometimes very low have a

315
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,120
incredibly high um standard deviation

316
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,360
that is almost as high as the as the

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
pain intensity itself

318
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,880
um so yeah we need to look into that

319
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,880
where where that comes from

320
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
and do more experiments but when looking

321
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,600
at the other results

322
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
except for the oldest 1bv1 which is 27

323
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
microtesla

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,839
all the results are very low 15

325
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,120
microseconds

326
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,360
or lower um which is interesting uh

327
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,120
and which could suggest that not only

328
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
were the directions irregular

329
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
in the south atlantic but also the field

330
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,440
was

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,440
maybe weaker or recurringly weak um a

332
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,079
few things to note is that none of these

333
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,639
sites show

334
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,639
transitional directions in the

335
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,519
directional study that we published

336
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
even though the intensities are so low

337
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,639
that you could

338
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,240
suggest or think that these are in

339
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,040
transitional times

340
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
another thing is that these three sites

341
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,519
give quite similar

342
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,760
uh paleo intensities and we're also

343
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,279
in directions so similar and that we

344
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,200
tested for serial correlation

345
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
and they were used as one directional

346
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,600
group

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,440
um yeah again we need more experiments

348
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,720
with ptrm steel checks to

349
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,920
test for md behavior um and i have more

350
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,760
sites that i can

351
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,320
perform plenty intensity experiments on

352
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,160
yeah what does this mean for the field

353
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,680
in the south atlantic

354
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,639
um if we do include these very high

355
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,720
intensities from

356
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,079
ladder hill 6 and ladder hill 13 with

357
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,160
the too slow behavior

358
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,320
that could mean that the field strength

359
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,480
is varying highly

360
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
um which would agree with the high

361
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
dispersion in directions

362
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,519
that we published in pnes um

363
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,160
but if these insanely high intensities

364
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,800
of like 80 micro tesla are due to

365
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,160
multi-domain behavior or overprints and

366
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,720
we would exclude them

367
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,560
all the intensities that we're left with

368
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
are overall very weak

369
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,320
uh which could suggest that the

370
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
anomalous behavior in the south atlantic

371
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,680
is actually

372
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
caused by referring uh recurring from

373
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,519
the first flux patch

374
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,839
um specifically on the chromatic

375
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
boundary

376
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,720
our conclusions uh is that saint elena

377
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,279
lab flows are not great

378
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
for poly intensity experiments but it is

379
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,639
possible

380
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
uh in the flows that we do get good

381
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,480
results for we see

382
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,600
very low intensities down to five micro

383
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
tesla

384
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,639
and some flows we see extreme too slow

385
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,720
behavior that can be interpreted as very

386
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,360
low or very high intensities with the

387
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,320
current set of selection criteria

388
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,920
this could mean either very varying

389
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,720
intensities were present

390
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,160
or if we wouldn't exclude these two

391
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,279
slope behavior uh

392
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,279
sites we mainly see very low value

393
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,880
intensities for saint elena

394
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,959
either way the existence of the

395
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,040
extremely weak piling intensities give

396
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,480
more evidence of the recurrent anomalous

397
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,639
behavior of the magnetic field

398
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,399
in the south atlantic on a million year

399
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,839
time scale

400
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,839
thank you

401
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,760
cool excellent nice talk thanks very

402
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,000
much for that

403
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,160
um i have a question but i think i'll be

404
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the good convener and ask does anyone

405
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,040
else have a question first before

406
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,639
i uh right okay

407
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,880
that's it everyone else had a chance i'm

408
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,560
jumping in um

409
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,120
it's just a curiosity uh bv 1-1

410
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,720
the sample the the temperature versus

411
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
susceptibility curve for that looks

412
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,920
funky it's like there's

413
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,680
at least what three different minerals

414
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,519
it does look funky and we have a lot of

415
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,839
these funky susceptibility

416
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,120
uh curves with a lot of phases a lot of

417
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,959
titanium but then even faces with

418
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,959
different amounts of titanium and

419
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,160
i i do not have enough knowledge to

420
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,440
interpret these

421
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,240
in detail uh i tried i made like little

422
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
prints of

423
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
all the different susceptibility results

424
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
that i had and tried to group

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
them together and it was almost

426
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,720
impossible we have so many different

427
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,320
uh behaviors even within one site

428
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,600
that yeah it's just uh yeah on mixing

429
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,880
the kind of temperature versus the

430
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
susceptibility cars and there's more

431
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,920
than one phase and there is is kind of

432
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,279
tricky it's one of the things that guys

433
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,639
up here are working on they're building

434
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,920
they're just running loads of loads and

435
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,279
loads of minerals to try and make a

436
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,320
library of them

437
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,600
but but pv one one is is like what

438
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,120
there's like definitely three different

439
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
phases in there and

440
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
you could kind of say maybe tighten the

441
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,680
magnetite for a couple of them but is it

442
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
really that you have that many different

443
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,560
phases of the same

444
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,320
oxide in there probably not but but yet

445
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,560
you're getting good data out of it

446
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,120
yeah which is interesting

447
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,160
is actually carrying that signal for you

448
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,759
sorry

449
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,600
which of these phases do you think

450
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,160
carrying the signal

451
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
um for bb1 i would have to dive into the

452
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,480
actual

453
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,480
right plots i don't think i have

454
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,160
any of them in here but i should have

455
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,959
them in a later

456
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
oh we can talk about it later i mean i

457
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,199
would have to look at which

458
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,160
component uh i used to interpret it

459
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,959
obviously but

460
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,759
um yeah i i don't know but from memory

461
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,959
which

462
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,120
component i guess um uh

463
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,680
does uh perhaps professor williams do

464
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,720
you have a question for us

465
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,600
i do yeah i'm about to expose my

466
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,800
ignorance of the geology really so i it

467
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,920
was a really nice

468
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,720
talk actually but i i didn't quite uh

469
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,120
get the ultimate conclusion in terms of

470
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,839
um

471
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
the prevalence of these uh low shear

472
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,079
velocity provinces

473
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,600
or these reverse flux patch patches and

474
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,120
actually if

475
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,799
are they inconsistent with each other

476
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,199
those two conclusions um

477
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,480
not necessarily no it's just that based

478
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
on my previous

479
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,760
uh study of the directions all we could

480
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,439
say was

481
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,880
there is some behavior on the core

482
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,959
mental boundary either

483
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,559
reverse flux patches and normal flux

484
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,880
patches on

485
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,400
alternating or there's something going

486
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,600
on but if it was

487
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,840
a weak field constantly and not

488
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,160
an unstable field that is sometimes high

489
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,760
and sometimes weak and averages out

490
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,400
as uh gad uh if it's mainly weak then

491
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
that would

492
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
suggest a reverse flux patch is

493
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,840
dominantly causing it

494
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,360
okay yeah and what is your what what is

495
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,360
your best guess

496
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,960
to be honest i do um i obviously think

497
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,679
about this a lot but i'm not sure if

498
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,120
i can use paleo intensities for this

499
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,720
best guess yet because i would

500
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,960
need to convince myself a little bit

501
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,440
more of these weak intensities first

502
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,720
um but i i think there's a combination

503
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,559
going on between the

504
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,240
uh the llsvp causing versus flux patches

505
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,799
um but maybe also something within the

506
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,600
core

507
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,640
in in the circulation there which ober

508
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,880
talks about

509
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
uh there's yeah i think there's way more

510
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,520
than one

511
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
situation causing all this uh

512
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,000
anomalous behavior in south atlantic

513
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,080
okay more complicated than maybe we

514
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
yeah i think so all right that's great

515
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,200
thank you very much

516
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,320
excellent and i think eduardo had a

517
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
question

518
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,919
what took his hand down oh it's been

519
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,720
answered already thanks

520
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,320
maybe do you have also like some thermal

521
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,600
magnetic remnants

522
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,760
measurement yes no okay

523
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,039
did i see the weather in the talk maybe

524
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,280
i missed them okay

525
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,400
yeah i focused it was already so obvious

526
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,120
to me anyway

527
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,120
that the rock mag didn't necessarily

528
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,520
show which we're going to get

529
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,039
good video intensities that i stay stuck

530
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,840
to susceptibility but um usually

531
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,840
because i did both for one sample i

532
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,600
usually put like the same material

533
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
in the coverage and then sister sample

534
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,840
in the vftb and it would be

535
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,840
very similar plots perfect thanks

1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,760
a combined ams and geochronological

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,399
study to provide new

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,200
temporal constraints on late caledonian

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,120
transparent

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,120
tectonism so when you're ready there

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,600
will

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,640
okay uh can you guys

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,519
hear me and can you see a screen that

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,960
has a poster on us yeah

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,640
cool um just before i kick off uh

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
just to follow on from ollie's chat

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
there i i hope you can all see the

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
utility and what he's attempting to do

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,239
here but uh

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,879
unfortunately my piggy bank has not yet

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
stretched

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,600
to purchasing a a proper working

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,680
vsm or vtfb so i may knock

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,640
or ollie may knock on your doors for

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,160
assistance with that

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
obviously that sort of machinery is

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,800
what's required to generate the volume

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,520
of data that he needs

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,960
um okay so uh this is the wee picture

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,239
that i took on my way in this morning we

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,640
got lots of nice snow

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,760
um uh in san andreas there overnight

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,439
um yeah this this talk is is

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,680
uh zooming out a little bit um and and

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,360
what we're attempting to do is add a

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,720
little bit of clarity

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,159
to the timing of uh transitions between

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,920
tectonic stress fields

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,640
during orogenesis um just as a bit of

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
context

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,320
this is a very simple uh diagram of

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
of what we kind of envisage um the

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,000
iapetus ocean to have looked at

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,079
in or around let's say 600 million years

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,520
500 million years ago

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,040
we have the acadian laurentian balkan

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,799
supercontinents

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
in kind of three separate corners of the

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,840
iapetus prior to the access ocean

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
closing

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,360
um and we we know that the closing of

47
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,719
of that ocean involves multiple orogenic

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
events such as the

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,640
grampian event where we have an island

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,640
arc colliding um

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
onto the margin of laurentia through the

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,079
penis scotian

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
and turneth closing of the turn-esque

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,479
sea uh

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
in the version of of of of miles and

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,200
woodcock

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
the acadian is the closure of this rick

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,720
ocean down here

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
but uh if if you go by the original

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
definition of the acadian actually

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
that's to do with

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,480
closure of the diopters ocean um

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
so we know that this closure event

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
occurred and we know that this closure

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,239
event brought

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,360
the the northern part of scotland into

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,760
contact with the

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,760
with the rest of the of the uk and and

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,519
we also understand that this

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,000
closure culminated in a period of trans

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
current tectonics initially

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,319
transpression

73
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
and later on transtension

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,160
the evidence for these transpressive and

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,319
transtensive events

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,920
and and indeed the closure of the hiatus

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
is evidence that most of us i think are

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,319
familiar with

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,319
that there's a wealth of paleontological

80
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,599
evidence to show the continents coming

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,319
together and closing

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,720
that there's a reasonable amount of

83
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,720
paleomagnetic data

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,440
there's a there's a huge amount of

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,159
evidence from sedimentary basins that

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
tell us

87
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,159
uh when regimes were in convergent

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,800
phases versus transtensive phases and of

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,159
course

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,840
there's structural evidence from things

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,519
like accretionary prisons

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,640
or fold and trust spells the issue with

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,599
all of this is that even with

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,519
these multiple sources of data that are

95
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,000
summarized here in a diagram from sopra

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,720
and woodcock

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
is is that there remains a discrepancy

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,319
of

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
somewhere anywhere from 10 to 15 maybe

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,000
even 20 million years

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,840
in when this final phase of closing and

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
transpression

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,159
translated into a period of trans

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
tension

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,840
um to try and close this gap that a

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,239
range of approaches

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,360
have been taken one very nice piece of

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,720
work done here by

109
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,799
miles in 2016 compiles quite a large

110
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,640
volume of

111
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,120
geochronological data and what you can

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,200
see

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,360
um of course these geochronological data

114
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,600
points are taken from a host of

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,479
late caledonian intrusions that occur

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
across

117
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,840
britain ireland and what we see of

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
course are

119
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
our spikes and troughs and spikes and

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,800
troughs

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,840
in the rate and volume of magma that's

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,720
being produced

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,919
at different times and and these uh

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
spikes and troughs

125
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,759
are correlated in a way with the

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,720
perceived

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,000
tectonic events so we have iapetus

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,560
subduction occurring over

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
here from in around 440 to in around

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
something like

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,479
you know 225 we have late transpression

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,880
in this model extending to 420 we have

133
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,560
transtension in this model onsetting at

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,720
420 extending down to something like 405

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
and then we have this acadian event

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,960
which in in

137
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,240
this model is closure of the rio ocean

138
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,600
not the attitudes occurring sometime

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,280
between four or five into

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,039
something like three three nine five um

141
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,080
and one of the nice things about these

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,120
data is that it gives you

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
absolute time stamps to say right at

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
this time

145
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,520
a certain volume of magma of a certain

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,960
chemistry was produced

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,759
um and and that's useful

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,759
and and in many instances the isotopic

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
and geochemical data arising

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
linked to those time stamps is tied to

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
tectonic

152
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,919
processes igneous petrogenic processes

153
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,600
and those petrogenic processes

154
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,639
are hung off the perceived tectonic

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,680
stress conditions but the problem of

156
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,520
course

157
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
is that the geochronology in itself

158
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,520
doesn't actually tell you

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,919
what the stress condition was and nor

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,880
this

161
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,720
really the isotopic data and the the the

162
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,479
tectonic framework

163
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,479
is is basically interpreted off this

164
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
but it's not a real direct reflection of

165
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,720
it

166
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,400
um and this results in ambiguity and two

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
very good examples of this two papers

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
published

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,520
one after another in the same year by

170
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,199
four people who are really leaders

171
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,800
in the geo caledonian geological world

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
so from woodcock versus dewey and

173
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,759
striking and they both conclude

174
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,360
differences of about 10 to 15 million

175
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,039
years between when this tectonic

176
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,080
framework changed from net

177
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:38,240
compression or transpression to net

178
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,520
trans tension um and the problem

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,440
really seems to be that there's a lack

180
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,720
of um there's a lack of

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,000
strain markers that can be temporarily

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
constrained

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,400
so it would be wonderful if we could

184
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
take things like little reduction spots

185
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
or imagine that the crust was full of

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
sponges

187
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,240
and we could see when the sponges were

188
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
being compressed or when the sponges

189
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,960
were being extended

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,759
um so with this in mind

191
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
i thought that perhaps we could use ams

192
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
to do this

193
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
there's nothing really new about

194
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,759
suggesting that ams can record tectonic

195
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
strain

196
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
people have been doing this for for many

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
years

198
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
one study that comes to mind is the ross

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,240
of mold in scotland where patronus at

200
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,039
hal

201
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,960
argued that the ams fabric was partly an

202
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,120
emplacement fabric but partly a tectonic

203
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,039
overprint

204
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,680
and and built a model around that um

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
but but what we decided to do was to

206
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
select a suite

207
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,360
of intrusions and our suite of

208
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,840
intrusions is in connemara on the west

209
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
coast of

210
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
ireland and these intrusions of course

211
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,199
are located right in the middle

212
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,720
of all this late caledonian tectonics

213
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,599
and this suite of intrusions should have

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
a

215
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,960
fairly tight constraint with regard to

216
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
their age so good good age

217
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,360
determinations

218
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
we need to collect ams data from each of

219
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
those intrusions which intrude

220
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
at different times and we want to

221
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,680
compare

222
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,000
the evidence that we see in those

223
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,319
intrusions to determine if we can pick

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
up differences in the strain history at

225
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
different times

226
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,759
during late stage or a genesis and after

227
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,680
we've done all that

228
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
we can rejoice and say we found

229
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
temporary constrained strain markers in

230
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,080
orogenic settings

231
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,759
or we can be bitterly disappointed when

232
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
we discover that the ams is just

233
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
recording magnaflow and not straight at

234
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,839
all

235
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,320
so let's see what happened so uh this is

236
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,299
a map

237
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,519
of connemara um

238
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,880
[Music]

239
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,959
i know a limited number of you will be

240
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,399
familiar with this or sorry

241
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,000
and many of you will be unfamiliar with

242
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,160
this um

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,920
it's located in in the middle part of

244
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,760
ireland on the west coast

245
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,760
uh it's one of the largest caledonian

246
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,839
complexes in britain ireland as it turns

247
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
out by square

248
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,080
kilometers and it's composed of a

249
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,000
central uh

250
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
large battlefield called kilkiren

251
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,360
batholith

252
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,880
and then several smaller intrusions one

253
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
is called karna pluton

254
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,600
out here to the west the main batholith

255
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,399
there's the round stone intrusion here

256
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,240
and the ome intrusion up to the

257
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
northwest

258
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
um now we went ahead and did some

259
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
geochronology on this and put it

260
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,720
together with

261
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,279
existing geochronology from people like

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,959
martin feely and quentin crowley

263
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
and you can show quite nicely basically

264
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,440
that these intrusions smaller intrusions

265
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,320
to the northwest are significantly older

266
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,399
um in and around 422 423 that's quite

267
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,200
nice because by dewey or viceracken's

268
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,200
model

269
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,720
or sopra's model and this should be

270
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,440
during transpression or should have

271
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,600
intruded sometimes during transgression

272
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,560
uh the kernel pluton in and around 14 to

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
409 m

274
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,720
a and nice that should be by

275
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,839
one model uh post transpression but by

276
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,320
the alternative model

277
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,519
it should be during trans tension and

278
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,640
then the main baffle which is in

279
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,640
are around 403

280
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,800
ish m a all the way down to successively

281
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,160
younger intrusions which cross cut the

282
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,600
kilk here and battle it down here and

283
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,640
these younger intrusions are

284
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,160
as young as 380 million years so that's

285
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,760
definitely the latest that transgression

286
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,760
could have been around 400

287
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,920
ma and 380 extends well into post

288
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,320
caledonian tectonics

289
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
so this suite of intrusions is quite

290
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,839
nicely placed spatially

291
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
in that it's right in the middle of the

292
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,240
tectonic framework for the late

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
caledonian

294
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,399
and temporally because it captures um

295
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,040
timings

296
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,680
in early well during transpression right

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,079
through that transtensive process

298
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,200
so we're going to show you some data

299
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
from roundstone

300
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,640
from omi from karna and from the main

301
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
batholith

302
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,640
and i'm going to blast through it

303
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,880
because i certainly don't want to run

304
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,040
over time

305
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,120
and the first part in our investigation

306
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,440
of course is through a nice

307
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,279
fairly robust rock magnetic

308
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
characterization so

309
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,480
building on from what tobias was talking

310
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,320
about earlier on

311
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
of course ams isn't as simple as just

312
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
taking a measurement and presuming that

313
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,560
the measurement reflects

314
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,839
what you think it should reflect and

315
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,920
we collected over 500 sample sites

316
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,279
across these intrusions an average of 12

317
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
sub-specimens per site

318
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,200
statistically quite robust and we've

319
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,959
characterized the magnetic mineralogy of

320
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
more than 80 of these samples

321
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
we've used temperature versus

322
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
susceptibility we've used irm

323
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,160
acquisition and birm fields

324
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,000
we use larry fuller test we use three

325
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,240
component demagnetization test

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,320
all with a view of constraining exactly

327
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,440
what the magnetic carriers are in here

328
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,519
and so that we can distinguish let's say

329
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
normal fabrics from inverse fabrics or

330
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
hydrothermal fabrics

331
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,839
and we could strip away fabrics that we

332
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,720
feel

333
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,079
are associated with post and placement

334
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
solid state processes

335
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,519
or hydrothermal alteration so this gives

336
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,560
us the best chance of

337
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,120
capturing let's say that the tectonic or

338
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,720
strain that occurred as consequences

339
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,399
tectonic strain

340
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,920
so this is an example of some of our um

341
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,000
temperature versus susceptibility

342
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,040
results and as you can see

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,240
uh fairly boring stuff um

344
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,360
temperature on the increase here in red

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,920
among cooling in blue and you can see

346
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,519
that

347
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,440
effectively all of these results just go

348
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,399
all the way up to almost 580 degrees

349
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
celsius

350
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
and then drop straight down to

351
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,959
paramagnetic behavior past security

352
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,880
temperature so this is you know very

353
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,959
very straightforward

354
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
near stoichiometric very very low

355
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,160
titanium uh

356
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,200
magnetite uh we went on and took

357
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,760
many of those samples and did some irm

358
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,120
and birm tests and again you can see

359
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,240
you know the samples reaching

360
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,720
saturations in very very low

361
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,440
irm fields again inferring that there's

362
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,279
magnetically very very soft magnetite

363
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
and we went ahead and did three

364
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,880
component tests on these again just to

365
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,240
check and see if

366
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,839
let's say there were um anomalous

367
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
proportions of things like hematite in

368
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,880
there or features that could be a

369
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,040
consequence of things like weathering

370
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,959
and things like that

371
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,320
and in the vast majority of samples as

372
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,880
expected of course

373
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
it is you know multi-domain or

374
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,279
fine-grained multi-domain

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,560
magnetite um expected to give you

376
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,959
you know normal ams fabrics

377
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,000
and in some of the samples however we

378
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,320
did find

379
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,320
a quite large proportion of sulfides for

380
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
example in this one g15

381
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
we've got a nice big peak here at about

382
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,839
300 degrees on the heating curve

383
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,680
pointing strongly towards the presence

384
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,720
of some sulfide minerals another

385
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,079
lump here occurring about 520 to me this

386
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
looks like magnetite that's actually

387
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,199
growing

388
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,240
as the sample has been heated and then

389
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
of course the cooling curve is

390
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
completely irreversible

391
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,120
and this is telling us that the magnetic

392
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,680
mineralogy of the sample is quite

393
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,079
different

394
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,440
from what is characteristic around the

395
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,720
other intrusions

396
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,920
um when we do our birm irm fields we can

397
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
see that the coercivity of these

398
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,279
minerals

399
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
are much higher as well um and in some

400
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,040
cases need fields of

401
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,839
greater than you know one to 1.2 teslas

402
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,560
or more to fully saturate pointing

403
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,079
towards

404
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
the presence of very high porosity

405
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,279
minerals that's atypical of the rest of

406
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,839
the intrusion

407
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,199
as it turns out many of these samples

408
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,000
have been

409
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,560
collected near a known porphyry that

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,680
occurs

411
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,279
in the center of the omi pluton in the

412
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,120
center of the kernel pluton and on the

413
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,560
side of the karna pluton

414
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
and in some instances this is very

415
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,959
obvious and you can see it in a field

416
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,839
like this where you get

417
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,440
very nice filler alteration mineral

418
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,639
molybdenite mineralization

419
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,079
chalcopyrite things like that but in

420
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,600
some samples you don't necessarily see

421
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,959
this very obviously in the field but you

422
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,760
do see it in the ams

423
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,639
or in the rock magnetic data and we were

424
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,000
able to strip

425
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,000
these samples away allowing us to again

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,199
focus on fabrics that are more closely

427
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,240
related or more

428
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,199
definitively related to uh tectonic

429
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,639
strain

430
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,800
during the original crystallization of

431
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,920
the magma

432
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,600
so jumping into some data um this is

433
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,480
some data from the round stone pluton

434
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:23,199
again about 423

435
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,199
mma um

436
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,040
the geological context for this is is

437
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,720
fairly tightly constrained people have

438
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,480
mapped this for the last 40

439
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,240
50 years quite simple really you have

440
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
some metagable in the country rock you

441
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,000
have dalaranian

442
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,000
supergroup sediments in the country rock

443
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
which are intruded by that metagabro

444
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,079
and all of this is understood to be in

445
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,320
the hanging wall to a regional thrust

446
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,759
which the foot wall is exposed through

447
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,959
this tectonic window

448
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,639
over here so in cross section the

449
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,560
geological setting looks a little bit

450
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,920
like this you the delaney dorm it's it's

451
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
a rhyolite in that in the in the

452
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,279
football

453
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,600
in the hanging wall you have the

454
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,079
metamorphic complex in connemara which

455
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
is

456
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,000
medicabro and radiant supergroups and

457
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,519
into that we have the

458
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,800
the round stone granite uh intruded

459
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,320
um now ams data on the left here we have

460
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,240
a contour plot

461
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,880
of shape and isosceles tj

462
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,399
just just contoured one of the very

463
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,160
striking things that you see

464
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,199
here is that all of the linear

465
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,959
uh or prolate fabrics tend to occur

466
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,800
along the near the center of this

467
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,720
intrusion and certainly along the sort

468
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,759
of north west southeast

469
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
um sort of axis

470
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,360
and one of the other very interesting

471
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,120
things we see is when we

472
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
kind of make detailed field maps in here

473
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,360
detailed field observations

474
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,240
is that where we see injections of

475
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
different

476
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
granuloid fascists but the contacts

477
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,720
between these fasces

478
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,680
are low bait or they are diffuse

479
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,279
inferring that um these are certainly

480
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
magma magma

481
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,040
interactions there's no evidence for any

482
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,199
solid-state deformation in here

483
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,079
so we can conclude that the fabrics

484
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,120
being recorded

485
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,799
are magmatic state fabrics

486
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,839
time there will how much

487
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:20,240
you've gone over so what yeah okay

488
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,039
cool um okay so i'll cut to the chase

489
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,600
when we

490
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,919
model that ams data up onto a stereo net

491
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,000
we see that the k3 axes

492
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,240
and to these ams data are sub horizontal

493
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,720
and orientated in the northeast and the

494
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,559
southwest of the stereo net

495
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,559
if i jump ahead because i'm out of time

496
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,640
now to the omi pluton

497
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,280
again we get a very similar structural

498
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,360
signature in our ams data again with a

499
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,919
sub-horizontal

500
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
are gently inclined k3 axes along the

501
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,400
northwest

502
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,480
um so it's sort of uh or sorry north

503
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,080
south west northeast axis

504
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,240
um again in the karna pluton

505
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200
we have a very very similar structural

506
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,280
signature

507
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
and at this point we're quite young

508
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,400
we're down to about 410

509
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,160
million uh years and again we very

510
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
compelling evidence to show that these

511
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,880
fabrics have been imparted

512
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
during the magmatic state samples taken

513
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,480
from this locality

514
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,120
with this biotite modal layering which

515
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,320
is very clearly a magmatic state fabric

516
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,840
still returns these steeply inclined

517
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
magmatic foliations

518
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,679
and the last sample site then is across

519
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,080
the main

520
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,039
battle across to cook here in baffleuf

521
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,480
along

522
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:44,240
this blue box this this blue

523
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,480
traverse here um and

524
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,240
long story short what we see is a pure

525
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,640
shear flattening fabric

526
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,240
to the north and as you traverse down to

527
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,520
the center of this intrusion

528
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,280
the fabrics change to become prolate

529
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,720
and critically the k3

530
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,280
axis rotates to become vertical

531
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,760
which is telling us that the sigma 1 has

532
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
now

533
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,679
flipped and is now in a vertical

534
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,400
position

535
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
so putting this together what we see is

536
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,200
that

537
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,000
about 420 and right down to 410 million

538
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
years

539
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,080
we have a sigma 3 that is sub horizontal

540
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,080
inferring that

541
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,200
magma is in a compressive uh field

542
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,120
but by the time we get to about 402

543
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
sigma 3 is vertical telling us that

544
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,320
sigma 1 is now vertical

545
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,400
and that is consistent with a trans

546
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,760
uh well what an extensional environment

547
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,960
i.e trans

548
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,280
uh tension so the

549
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
final model that we've come up with is

550
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,480
where we have

551
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
the tectonic framework of connemara the

552
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,039
square roots faulted

553
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,440
south highland boundary falls to the

554
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,440
north during regional sinister

555
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,720
transpression sigma one of course

556
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,360
is on the horizontal uh plane

557
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
um promoting anti-clockwise block

558
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,960
rotation

559
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,600
as the only pluton and round stone

560
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,760
pluton

561
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,600
intrude and by the time we get to 410

562
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,559
the karna pluton

563
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,520
is intruding still within this net

564
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,840
compressive

565
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,320
stress field um imparting steep

566
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,400
uh kind of a steeper structural fabric

567
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,440
within that intrusion and by the time we

568
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,760
get to

569
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
400 ma the stress field has evolved to

570
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,240
be

571
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,600
transtensive allowing larger volumes of

572
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,320
magma to intrude

573
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,280
and the structural fabric recorded in

574
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,400
magmas that cool

575
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,640
at that time and are provided basically

576
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,679
sub-horizontal magnetic fabric

577
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,679
and a sub-horizontal magnetic

578
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,679
lining so

579
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,200
that's just the summary there based off

580
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
these data it would

581
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,559
indicate the transtension in this part

582
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,480
of the origin belt

583
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,480
didn't really onset until after 410

584
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,000
and we feel that this provide this is

585
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,039
the potential to provide a nice new

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,360
tool that allows us to provide temporal

587
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,799
valley constrained strain markers in

588
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,559
origin in general

589
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,640
it's worth noting that we've tried this

590
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,039
and done it all and had to go at it and

591
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
mull

592
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,799
and edit and we're getting similar

593
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,559
results at similar times

594
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,080
so it suggests that this works not just

595
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:25,280
in connemara but

596
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,280
across origin in general thank you

597
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,919
um thanks for that will um adrian you

598
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,840
said your talk's not that long

599
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
so if you're willing then we can have

600
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,200
one very quick question

601
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,200
if that's okay with you adrian

602
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,000
yes

603
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,440
oh so yep yep go first

604
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,280
so which of the two models was correct

605
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
can i tell nigel woodcock he's right or

606
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,640
wrong

607
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,159
i'd prefer to tell him myself uh for

608
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,919
fear that you just dropped me in

609
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,880
and i'll make an enemy forever but in

610
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,520
in in in my base of the data that i can

611
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,039
see there

612
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,240
i can see trans tension on the setting

613
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,480
after 410 because i have an intrusion

614
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,520
that is 410 million years old

615
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,080
and there are steep fabrics in it and

616
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,400
that's

617
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,000
consistent with all the intrusions that

618
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,840
we have data from

619
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,559
that we know intruded during

620
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,559
transgression

621
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,000
so

622
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,480
that's presuming that you accept that

623
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,840
the ams fabric is in fact

624
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,440
another process but i evidence for that

625
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,880
which i think works okay uh

626
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,679
yeah colonel's hand is up there so we'll

627
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,320
just one quickly

628
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,480
so so your transition from transgression

629
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,880
to trans tension you've modeled

630
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,840
with anti-clockwise rotation in in the

631
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,559
area of the main granite

632
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,400
every published study of rocks ranging

633
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,559
in age from ordovician right the way

634
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,679
through to silurian in that area

635
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,440
are all clockwise

636
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,120
and there's a study by robertson on the

637
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,480
connemara gabbro which is

638
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,320
in the south western corner uh there's

639
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,480
two papers by mark smithers

640
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,919
on silurian rocks that actually range

641
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
right the way along

642
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
the northern part of that area and and

643
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,200
every single published rotation is

644
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
clockwise

645
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,360
yeah fair enough uh i think you find

646
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,320
dewey jakes and reevy as well

647
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,840
also have a have the opposite block

648
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,919
rotation model

649
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,600
um and well the truth be told

650
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,679
if that block is rotating one way or the

651
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,000
other doesn't necessarily

652
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,520
change the broader model i just have to

653
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,159
have a rotation going one way or the

654
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,320
other

655
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,799
but if you if you take a wee ice cube

656
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,039
and put a sinister strike slip across

657
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,440
top well that's the direction it goes so

658
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,279
it depends which side you pin it on well

659
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,480
it does yes yeah

660
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,400
well yeah yeah so i have a very

661
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,840
it's sort of a quick follow-up question

662
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,279
but have you measured the

663
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,840
um remnants on any of these samples

664
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,840
um i have yes

665
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,240
off the top of my head but yes we did

666
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,640
all that as a as part of the

667
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,600
the first step of the rock car rockman

668
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,679
characterization

669
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,520
yeah yeah but but you haven't done you

670
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,919
haven't d-magged any of them

671
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,919
uh we did yeah well we de-magnet afd mag

672
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,360
did those directions show anything

673
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,360
uh i not off-hand

674
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,960
but what are you alluding towards those

675
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,200
i can check

676
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,039
well well well well you know very simple

677
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,480
test would be if you've got any coherent

678
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
remnants and there are any coherent

679
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,320
remnants directions you could

680
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,360
see are they rotated or not your block

681
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240
rotation

682
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,520
yeah so so actually for at the only

683
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
intrusion i i

684
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,799
attempted to do that because there's a

685
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,400
well i

686
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,679
hypothesize you got two shear zones

687
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
bounding a block of granite in the

688
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,039
middle which we have data and remnants

689
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,960
data from

690
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,840
but in my opinion i didn't really see

691
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
i didn't think the data looked

692
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
particularly good weren't particularly

693
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
reliable uh

694
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,559
mike petronas agreed and i just thought

695
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,940
okay fair enough and i left it at that

696
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,679
um

697
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:16,400
[Music]

698
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,440
but i suppose it's not the you wouldn't

699
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,679
necessarily expect

700
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,640
the granite futons themselves to be

701
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,559
rotating you're expecting the blocks

702
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
adjacent to them to rotate so i suppose

703
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,760
if you wanted to test that you want to

704
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,279
have a look at the dikes that are cross

705
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,200
cutting

706
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,720
maybe the earlier dikes or perhaps even

707
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,400
the um some of the

708
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,240
earlier grampian intrusions

709
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
because they would have been obviously

710
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,159
pre onset of transgression

711
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,919
and yeah but the grampian ones are

712
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,279
clockwise rotated this is the

713
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,080
this is the problem yeah um

714
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,440
okay yeah yeah maybe we should chat

715
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,799
maybe we should chat about this but

716
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,200
there's some more i i

717
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,799
collected a whole lot of samples from

718
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,559
their donkeys years ago and we measured

719
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,480
fabrics we went for all the mafic

720
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,679
enclaves oh cool yeah um

721
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,279
and i'm trying to remember there was

722
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,200
there was some coherence in that in the

723
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,000
fabric data but the remnants data was

724
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
just

725
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,320
shied yeah mike had me treat because i i

726
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,880
mean i did the

727
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
mag experiments as a phd student uh so

728
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,679
he was just basically telling me what to

729
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,279
do and i did what i was told for the

730
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,520
most part sometimes

731
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,679
um but yeah we treated them with you

732
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,919
know low temperature cryogenic before we

733
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,320
d

734
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,320
magnum and stuff and i mean it's such

735
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,559
coarse-grained multi-domain stuff

736
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,559
that

737
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,080
was a bit iffy and so i didn't dig into

738
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
it too much

739
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,440
yeah i'd be useful to chat with you

740
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,000
afterwards about it

741
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
let's do it let's do that i'll i'll drag

742
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,480
stuff from

743
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,480
the bottom drawer somewhere

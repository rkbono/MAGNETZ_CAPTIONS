1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,159
us richard anik

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,960
and michael and the logo being made by

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
simuloid

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,480
as we're saying the logo was because

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,600
there are many magnets but not many

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
magnets

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
with zed so i think we can stick with

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,640
this

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,519
um from now on

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,199
uh usually the seminars are 25 minutes

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,920
um

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,360
and then after that we usually have 10

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,079
to 15 minutes

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,239
for questionable discussions uh text

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,280
questions are always welcome you can

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,160
you can have them in the text box um and

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
we can read them up for you

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,239
it's an informal environment so if you

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,600
need to go you can you can go

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,360
and after the seminar is finished

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,760
we will be here for a not recorded time

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,800
uh to catch up if you're interested

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,320
so the the youtube uh

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,960
the youtube uh video is gonna be hosted

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,760
by earth reference magic team which for

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,600
which we are

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,280
very grateful and there's gonna be

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
uh also uh do i associated with that

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,840
the schedule for now is today we have

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,280
frenzy milanese

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,799
and in october 14 we will left sayona

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,720
cantonsano and on 25th of november

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,360
at the atema in december we're gonna

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,759
have a christmas break

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,840
i think that's the plan so far we always

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,479
looking for new speakers for the

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
following year and any if you have any

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,040
idea criticism to

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
where to improve this series of seminars

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
they're all welcome

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
so for now i'm gonna have i am gonna

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
leave

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,920
florencia to her presentation

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,320
which you can you can start sharing your

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:08,959
screen

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:12,000
sharing mine

47
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,360
we are still not seeing it okay yes are

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,680
you seeing my screen now

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
yes no yes okay thank you

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,599
okay and i will

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,599
so you're seeing the whole

52
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,720
screen presentation right yes thank you

53
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,400
florence yes

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,800
good okay so hello everybody thank you

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,879
for

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,879
for being here um this presentation is

57
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,120
based uh on the results of my phd thesis

58
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,400
uh so it's pretty much an already

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,120
finished work

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
so here i'm going to summarize all those

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,879
results

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
and and actually the last paper coming

63
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
out from it was

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
published at the beginning of this of

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
this year

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,959
and and it's very classic of um max trap

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,000
uh job and many institutions cooperated

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,200
for this work to be done uh the

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,040
i did all the writing and analyzing

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,480
and the roadmap analysis at the buenos

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,560
aires uh palu magnetic laboratory

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,400
the institute antarctic argentina

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,080
provided the

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,560
logistics for the field work and i

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
processed all my paleomagnetic samples

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,200
at

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,959
caltech's laboratory and this is the

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
people that cooperated

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,239
with a whole or at least with part of

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,720
the of the work

81
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
i organized the presentation in four

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
sections

83
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
so at first i will give you a summary of

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,720
the

85
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,280
stratigraphy of the generos spacing

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
then i will point out some interesting

87
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,920
aspects

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,040
or some of the problems i i think

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,920
uh it will be the problems i think will

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
be solved

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,400
with magnetostratigraphy then i will

92
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
show the results

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,519
and then the conclusion or the or the

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
final

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,519
chronostratigraphic framework coming out

96
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,720
from the magnetostratigraphy

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,359
so here is the james rose spacing it is

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,759
located here at the northeastern tip of

99
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,199
the antarctic peninsula

100
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,840
and and going from from bigger to

101
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,880
smaller

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,240
the literature refers uh to to

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,040
everything

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,639
to the sedimentary cover below the

105
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
waddle sea

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,720
uh as well basing then

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
uh when we are speaking about the

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
offshore

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,840
uh antarctic peninsula platinum platform

110
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
basing we

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,199
speak of larsen basing

112
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,800
and the gangster spacing is basically

113
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,080
the outcropping

114
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,400
part of the larsen basin

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,520
and and the outcrops that that form the

116
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,880
gemstone spacing

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,680
are in this archipelago from james ross

118
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,680
island and

119
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,520
smaller surrounding islands plus

120
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,320
a few southern smaller outgrabs here but

121
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,440
basically gems were spacing is this this

122
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,440
this archipelago

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,320
so the spacing started as a backer basin

124
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,759
with an active arc

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,199
uh place here at the antarctic peninsula

126
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,000
and and has more than

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
six kilometers of sedimentary thickness

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
that

129
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,120
span from beramin to eoc

130
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,160
and the target of our work

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,600
is the cretaceous infield of basin

132
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,960
which is divided in two mega sequences

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,000
the first one is from from it goes from

134
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,039
the option to connection and

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,319
it is the deep marine sediments uh from

136
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,680
the gustav group

137
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,880
and and this group is it was the

138
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,120
positive during

139
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,160
an an active uh faulting environment

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,560
an extensional environment

141
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
and any and it is coarser than the

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,759
marami group which is our

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,319
specific target uh and and these fine

144
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,440
sediments from the mrambi group

145
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,560
are interpreted as the deposits of a

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,960
grading shelf developed during

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
an inversion stage of the basin

148
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,600
so um there are many many

149
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,960
characteristics for this spacing to be

150
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,240
important but

151
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,360
i i put the the three i believe uh

152
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,759
the most notorious uh this basically is

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
extremely phosphorous there are a lot of

154
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,599
faucets here

155
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,280
uh a lot of there so a lot of

156
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,160
bibles ammonites um

157
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,000
gastropods uh many vertebrates

158
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,039
palinomorphs there are dinosaurs

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
marine reptiles birds everything so and

160
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,520
fossils

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,120
they they have this very well state of

162
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,120
preservation

163
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,800
there is also the cretaceous paleogene

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,199
boundary there uh at

165
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,840
marambi or simone island and it has

166
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,240
citrocarbon producer potential not many

167
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,240
oil exploration has been made in

168
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
antarctica because it is not allowed but

169
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,360
it's another aspect we are not of course

170
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,440
talking about

171
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,199
this in this presentation so so these

172
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,560
characteristics may

173
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,160
make a make this spacing like a like a

174
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,400
reference

175
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,960
a reference section because it it

176
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,599
records everything that happened

177
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,919
uh after a breakup so it's a very

178
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,759
continuous sedimentary record from

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,800
boramian to eocene and and it is

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,960
also a very interesting place to to

181
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
study

182
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,479
biodiversity patterns and extinction

183
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,599
patterns in polar regions

184
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,599
before and after the mass extinction

185
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,639
uh but there are there are some problems

186
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,319
and and and this this problems that

187
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,199
that hamper the the quality of of being

188
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,240
a reference section for the spacing

189
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,520
uh they are the

190
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,319
the diagram is uh in the extinction

191
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,599
patterns

192
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,560
and the endemism of these species so so

193
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,520
many

194
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,440
species are are from antarctica

195
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
exclusively and they are not in

196
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
in the rest of the world so it's very

197
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,479
difficult to correlate

198
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,519
uh to correlate them in in

199
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,920
several funnel groups uh they

200
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
die earlier in antarctica than in the

201
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,560
rest of the world

202
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,440
so the the intra-basin correlation was

203
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
was based on on ammonite assemblages

204
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,320
this guy

205
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,680
did the the main the main job

206
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,160
and and what we see in the james ross

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,040
infield in the cretaceous infant is that

208
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,279
uh

209
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,320
for the early companion many ammonites

210
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,600
groups many ammonite groups disappear

211
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,000
and also these bibles and ceramics and

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,800
many organisms disappear

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,160
early during the early companion but for

214
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,640
example these bibles

215
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,640
they are found in south america in

216
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,320
tierra del fuego

217
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
they are found even in the early

218
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
restriction

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
so um oh

220
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
and and the other one that happens here

221
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,640
is after the early companion

222
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,279
uh cosmetics they become a very dominant

223
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,080
uh with respect to the rest of the

224
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,560
funnel groups

225
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,800
so so this diaphragmism and endemism

226
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,200
makes it difficult to

227
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,880
for this placing to be a correlated

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
level

229
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,080
uh here is uh an uh current station

230
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,880
graphic framework

231
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
and and it is divided in two areas so

232
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,320
the the norway

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,040
the northwest james rose space scenario

234
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
it involves uh the the most proximal

235
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,399
facials

236
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,160
which is logical because the the magic

237
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,200
arc is here

238
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,920
and also the older species so that this

239
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
uh gustaf group it it only aircrafts

240
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,600
here at

241
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,560
northwestern chambers island and the

242
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,079
southeast area of the basin

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,120
includes um all the distal phases

244
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,160
and also the the newest units and and

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,000
the same units

246
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,760
uh reaches more thickness in the distal

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
area so basically as we move to the

248
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,279
southeast

249
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:50,160
we go for from older and proximal

250
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,160
to younger and and deeper

251
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:58,079
so this this mag strat work

252
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,000
i i'm going to present it separated into

253
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,760
in proximal and and digital area

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,480
and here in green uh what we have is

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,519
is the different it's a summary of the

256
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
different

257
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,880
age models proposed by

258
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
by different paletologists so depending

259
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,040
on on which

260
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,839
organism they base their biostratigraphy

261
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,640
on

262
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:26,000
uh we have different h models so from

263
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,160
planomorphs and ammonites

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
declinations and tonium boundaries is

265
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,440
placed

266
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
in the gustav group and morambio group

267
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,040
uh boundary

268
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,760
the and and a little higher according to

269
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,360
energetics and strontium stratigraphy

270
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,279
so what the first the most is the

271
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,240
centonian companion boundary because

272
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,920
according to

273
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,079
olivero's ammonites it is at the base of

274
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,920
santa martin formation

275
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,800
here and according to energetics and an

276
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,959
instruction

277
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,839
isotopic stratigraphy it is pretty much

278
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,120
higher in the in the beta member

279
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,720
so we will try to and there is no

280
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480
much difference between the companion

281
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
restriction boundaries so we will try to

282
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,480
sort

283
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,079
these these discrepancies with

284
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,560
magnetostratigraphy

285
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,839
so um in the proximal part of the basin

286
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,959
we sampled uh these units so that the

287
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,320
upper gustup group

288
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,480
and santa marta and the lower snow hill

289
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,680
is formation

290
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,279
and this is a detailed uh geological

291
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,560
scheme

292
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,680
so this this composite

293
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,360
uh stratigraphical column

294
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,240
was was made by oliver like 20 years ago

295
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
and and the correlations between partial

296
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,399
sections

297
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,880
was based on ammonites and mythology but

298
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,959
but mostly on ammonites and sandwiches

299
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,880
so here is hl section here is hl section

300
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,680
here is mot here's mlt within the

301
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,600
the center marked formation and so on so

302
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,839
so as we move southeast we go

303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
we go higher stratigraphically

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
so this is for you guys to see how is

305
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,720
the

306
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,040
field work done there is an

307
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,959
there is an argentinian antarctic base

308
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,959
here and it drops us

309
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,880
by helicopter to every year

310
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,600
field area field work area so we set

311
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,440
these campsites in the place for one

312
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
month one month and a half

313
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
depending on how many hours we have to

314
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,880
sample and and

315
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,199
we eat here we we put our stuff here

316
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,120
we sleep in this pyramidal tent and we

317
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,120
go to the bathroom here

318
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,519
and the sections were measured with with

319
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,720
jacob's stuff

320
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,440
and and we drilled so all all samples

321
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,480
were

322
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,000
oriented uh there most of the samples

323
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,680
the problem with them around the group

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,199
sediments is

325
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,360
that they are very unconsolidated so so

326
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,680
this was not the rule not many harvests

327
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,720
to treat so most of the times

328
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,079
uh we had to find concretions in in the

329
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,279
unconsolidated

330
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:17,839
sediments and sometimes we had to

331
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,839
take block samples

332
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,160
sorry it's not okay so these are these

333
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,560
are views

334
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,760
from the outcrops this is the a view of

335
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,519
hl

336
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,240
here hidden like formation

337
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,880
this is a view looking to the cell from

338
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,279
g

339
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,440
120 section within the alpha member

340
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,480
this is a picture of heartbed but

341
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,079
definitely not

342
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,720
the rule f16 which is here beta member

343
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,079
still santa marta formation and and this

344
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
is a picture of

345
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,720
uh it's no helium formation this this a

346
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,680
long short section

347
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,519
i did not take these samples this these

348
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,480
two sections were sampled

349
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,120
by call tech group like one or two years

350
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,839
before i

351
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
got into the project but but i analyzed

352
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,360
the data

353
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,360
i used the data

354
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,519
so some rock mag i usually bore

355
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,279
geologists to death with rockman inside

356
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,399
your body diagrams and now that i have

357
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
the public

358
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,480
i won't because i don't have time but uh

359
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,199
what would be in fear from from from

360
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,240
rock mags we have titan magnetite

361
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,680
uh 36 cycles show that

362
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,199
samples saturate about a 200

363
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,800
and 300 milli teslas uh

364
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,639
passivities are about tens of million

365
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,000
teslas

366
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,360
and and from lori fewer tests we

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,920
we see that arm is harder to to wash

368
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,560
than irm when applying alternating

369
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,240
fields

370
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,440
so for us it's tetano magnetizer

371
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
the magnetic carrier

372
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,480
and and paleomagnetic behaviors for for

373
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,199
this section and it's

374
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,160
it's pretty constant for for the whole

375
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,399
basin for the homoarami group

376
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,440
so most of the time uh

377
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,720
demagnetization could not proceed

378
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
further than

379
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,120
than 300 degrees maybe

380
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
450 if you were lucky samples just went

381
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
crazy about

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,440
the temperature probably because of new

383
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,279
mineral formations

384
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,839
uh most components were isolated

385
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,519
using principal component analysis in

386
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,480
some cases we applied

387
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,480
brain circles and and the main

388
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,600
demagnetization process was

389
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,040
thermal with a

390
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,839
with a low temperature low fill

391
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,240
cycle so some sometimes when during

392
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,480
those

393
00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:00,639
first steps of two nitrogen cycles and

394
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,079
naf until 69 nanoteslas maybe we obtain

395
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,839
a viscous component

396
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:11,199
most of the time yeah i mean samples

397
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,120
just died uh before we could delete all

398
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,720
the magnetization this is an exception

399
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,760
but i wanted to show it

400
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,400
anyway in which by 550 degrees we still

401
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,160
have the

402
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,559
40 of the magnetization so probably some

403
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,559
magnetite is present here too

404
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,760
um and these are the results for the

405
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,640
for the norwest area so

406
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,520
this is declination this is inclination

407
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,360
and and

408
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
and the dots are for uh vgp palliative

409
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,559
latitude

410
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,240
the angular distance between bgps and

411
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,000
mean value

412
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,200
so what we see here is at the base

413
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,880
uh a more or less continuous it's

414
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,280
everything normal at the base so

415
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,880
until g 120 until here

416
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:08,799
everything is is normal right

417
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,400
and from g 120 and up

418
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,400
everything becomes reverse

419
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,919
except for for one two

420
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,200
three normal levels but everything is

421
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,720
pretty much reversed

422
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,840
until the upper half of f16

423
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,440
here within the beta member

424
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,240
and from then and up normals

425
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,120
start again and everything is pretty

426
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,679
much normal except for these two

427
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,320
these two levels so putting all these

428
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,840
partial

429
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,840
sections together why it's not moving

430
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,600
sorry just frozen

431
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,160
okay so putting all these partial

432
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,360
sections together we built this

433
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:07,039
this composite column

434
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,280
and we know for sure that that this is

435
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,080
normal cretaceous upright because every

436
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,240
fossil says

437
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,120
so it can't be anything else so

438
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
and and all this reverse it it is it has

439
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,240
to be c

440
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:26,520
33r and and from and and we know

441
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,760
for sure that this boundary here it is

442
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,799
c33rc33n we don't know how far

443
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,919
we reach in c33n and

444
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,799
and if if you see here that there is not

445
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:43,120
there is a lot of sedimentary thickness

446
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,000
uh covered so not very continuous

447
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,320
uh record here so so we did not

448
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,720
correlate these two levels with anything

449
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,679
and

450
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,200
and we did not make any correlation with

451
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,520
um

452
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,360
the the global polarity time scale for

453
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,720
for this in thermal but but we know

454
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,480
for sure that this is cf34n

455
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,280
and this is c33r

456
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
so we found or or yeah we found a

457
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,760
centonian companion boundary

458
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,760
here uh we think alpha member

459
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,240
around here and and there are two

460
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,840
proposals for

461
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,760
for for the age of this of this boundary

462
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,520
so according to

463
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,880
to all and collaborators the the limit

464
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,280
agrees with the base of c33r

465
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,280
and and according to the international

466
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,880
commission on stratigraphy they adopt

467
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,280
this um this last apparent datum

468
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,440
of this crinoid for for for the

469
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
centonian companion binary but of course

470
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,440
we are on

471
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,600
on team base of 33 hours so

472
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
so this is the the boundary we take

473
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,200
so now we've been uh moving to the

474
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,159
digital part of the basic

475
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,039
um there are there are many isolated

476
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,080
sections here

477
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,440
to to put together so we will start with

478
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,520
with the vessel

479
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,080
rubber formation which is partially key

480
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,679
valium to santa marta so it's slightly

481
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,320
slightly younger and what we have for

482
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,200
rabbit formation

483
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
it has three overlapping sections so

484
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,760
these

485
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,280
three sections they they record more or

486
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,679
less the same structure graphic in

487
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
variable

488
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,440
so these are views of of the sections

489
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,440
this is a view from

490
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,280
base to top from from hamilton north

491
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,360
this is a view of of uh of robot from

492
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
from redonda point and and here at the

493
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,720
top

494
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,720
there are this uh mayas implies in

495
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,679
volcanics from the generous island

496
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,559
volcanic group

497
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,080
which are in at the top of many

498
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,440
cretaceous outcrops

499
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,720
uh there is more rock back here um

500
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,360
so from from low temperature

501
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,679
thermomagnetic susceptibility curves we

502
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
see

503
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,960
much paramagnetic contribution

504
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,919
um from a high temperature

505
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,520
what we see is all curves are not

506
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,440
reversible

507
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:17,120
so probably new i mean new minerals form

508
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,000
during heating and another thing i i

509
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,039
infer from from these curves is that

510
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,400
there is no

511
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,320
uh blocking temperature

512
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,840
there is no mineral with a blocking

513
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,480
temperature below

514
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,799
500 550 degrees celsius

515
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,159
and these are the magnetic parameter

516
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,400
parameters which are

517
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,159
very similar to the proximal or this is

518
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,640
not only for the rabbit formation these

519
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,919
are for the whole southeast area

520
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,360
and again creativities are are around

521
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,600
tens of milli teslas

522
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,080
so that the three columns put together

523
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,360
it was it was very easy to over uh to

524
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,520
correlate them i mean

525
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,200
i mean besides uh the ammonites

526
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,080
assemblages there is this

527
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
green volcanic plastic bed very obvious

528
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,159
very notorious it was in

529
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,520
in the three sections so what we see

530
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,559
in the three columns is a a basal

531
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,159
reverse and an upper normal

532
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,960
in thermal so the the

533
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,760
their version is within assemblage

534
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,840
ammonite's

535
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,080
assemblage six and we also found this uh

536
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,039
this reverse synthetic in all three

537
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,120
columns

538
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,200
but but this is the only possible

539
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,320
correlation because this reverse has to

540
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,480
be

541
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,480
c33r because of the ammonites

542
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,520
so uh about the rabbit formation we have

543
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
the the hamilton

544
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,799
point member there's no hilal

545
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,240
information

546
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,880
and we here have three sections too

547
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
but these three sections do not overlap

548
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,039
they are one

549
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,039
about uh the other

550
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,360
so these are our views from from from

551
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,320
from the sections this is hc from base

552
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,960
to top

553
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,480
base to top and mechanics of the

554
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,679
generous island

555
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,360
this is a picture of the sample all the

556
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,520
mirami group was

557
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,960
unconsolidated but that hamilton point

558
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,400
remember is the worst

559
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,679
it's it's just not healthy it's terrible

560
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
to work there

561
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,080
and this is the middle section this is a

562
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,400
view of the middle section another

563
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,919
another view from from base to top from

564
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,760
base to the top

565
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,799
h e section and this is the upper

566
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,480
partial section h d from from base to

567
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,039
top

568
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,720
base to top and then the volcanics here

569
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,600
up here

570
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,320
so so putting all the results together

571
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,159
what we see

572
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,000
in this in this three section is

573
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,919
everything looks pretty much normal and

574
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,039
and one thing i forgot to say when

575
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,919
when you see solid symbols is because

576
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,159
uh directions were isolated using a

577
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,440
principal components analysis

578
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,320
so empty symbols were obtained from

579
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,080
from great seal groups so except for

580
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,480
this level here

581
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,320
and maybe this one here but pretty close

582
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,520
to a horizontal and

583
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,799
this one and and this one

584
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:25,279
most of the of the sections are normal

585
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,279
so we will see the the correlation

586
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,120
together so

587
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,600
so crossing the sea uh the the last part

588
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,279
of

589
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,400
our outcrops are uh here at

590
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,720
cerro nevada or snow hill island so

591
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,400
central eclipse member

592
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,039
it outcrops here in this moon attack

593
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
it's a very um it's a very particular

594
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
place

595
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,559
you can attack because you're surrounded

596
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,120
by

597
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,520
eyes and you're here and on this spacing

598
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,640
and all you see around you is eyes it's

599
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,960
pretty it's pretty depressing sometimes

600
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,080
and well here at the back is the center

601
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,200
eclipse member

602
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,200
we were just we we were just dropped by

603
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
the helicopter here so we were setting

604
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,760
up

605
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,279
the campsite so this actually clicks

606
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,080
here and this is a view of the section

607
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,520
taken from some point around here and

608
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,960
and this is the section we

609
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,960
we we sampled

610
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,600
and these are the results for for the

611
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,080
sun for eclipse member

612
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:34,480
so um normal at the best uh

613
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:37,600
a short reverse in thermal and into

614
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,159
normal levels again and then everything

615
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,039
is

616
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,039
is pretty much reversed until the top

617
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,120
and behaviors well they they

618
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,480
they are pretty similar to the rest of

619
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,919
the

620
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,840
group units so there is one one off

621
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,840
level here

622
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,159
and above the sanctuary cliffs number so

623
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,240
one thing i didn't

624
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,960
tell you our our principle to define a

625
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
polarity

626
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,960
it was you you had to you have to have

627
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
more than one level in a row that's why

628
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,840
we

629
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,919
i i do not consider this as a different

630
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,760
polarity level

631
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,679
so another sanctuary case member we have

632
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,720
this spa peninsula perhaps

633
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,320
from uppers no helium formation hustle

634
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,440
and crack formation and and

635
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,679
base of lopez de vertadono

636
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,480
so this is the map of the peninsula and

637
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,000
and this is

638
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,480
the section we walked we we had to move

639
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,760
laterally here because we ran out of

640
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,760
of concretions to treat here and um

641
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,200
this is a view of the of the snow hill

642
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,320
island and haslam

643
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,799
contact yellow and and green

644
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,840
taken from the helicopter this is the

645
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,000
same

646
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,880
uh contact from from another point of

647
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,039
view and

648
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,000
and here are the dame raw asylum

649
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,200
volcanic group

650
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,919
uh dykes and and they basically cross

651
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,039
all the

652
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:04,399
all the penis line and they reach to to

653
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,679
seymour or marambi island too

654
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,240
and this is a view of the castle crack

655
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,760
uh lopez of berlin contact yeah green

656
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,760
and gray

657
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,039
and this is a picture of the concretions

658
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,240
we

659
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,799
we drilled oh

660
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,399
and there is a hut here in historical

661
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,440
hat from a

662
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,720
from a norwegian expedition uh

663
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,760
that happened in 1901

664
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,240
so this these guys uh were supposed to

665
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,200
stay

666
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
one year here at cerro nevado at snow

667
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,360
hill

668
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,159
and they built this this this hot that

669
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,720
now is like

670
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,520
falling because it's built on a on a

671
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,200
nice court um moraine

672
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
and these guys were supposed to stay for

673
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,600
one year but the

674
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,120
boda that should have uh picked them up

675
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,520
didn't make it through the ice so

676
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,279
they have to stay two years there but no

677
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,399
food so that they had to

678
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:04,159
hunt seals and penguins to survive

679
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,880
and this is the 2016 crew emulating the

680
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,120
norwegian

681
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,399
expedition and you barely can

682
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,559
distinguish which one is the original

683
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,880
so these are the results for the spa

684
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,000
peninsula

685
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,760
and everything is reversed here so so

686
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,279
the first time i saw this i

687
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,600
i i thought that i don't know maybe it

688
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,559
is

689
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,360
magnetized maybe this this this myosin

690
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,320
dikes

691
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,320
burned all the cretaceous and but it is

692
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
not we we actually compared uh mean

693
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,559
directions we did a sort of

694
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,960
of baking test and and no there is no

695
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,840
remagnetization and

696
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,480
and behaviors are very similar than to

697
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,679
the rest of

698
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,399
of of the group so

699
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,720
everything is reversed except for some

700
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,039
isolated levels everything is reversed

701
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,840
from

702
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,840
from base to top

703
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,720
okay yeah i'm almost done so

704
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,399
uh this is the the correlation we did uh

705
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,799
so this is c33n and and this is

706
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,000
definitely c31r

707
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:19,919
so uh so what is in the middle has to be

708
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,679
c32 and and and we apply the polysecular

709
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,039
variation filter

710
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,320
and and this one we would put it as a

711
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,480
question mark because

712
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,000
uh well it is just one level and and

713
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,760
it's pretty close to

714
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,480
transitional so so

715
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,880
so this is the correlation we did so for

716
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,520
for

717
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,320
for seeing everything together like

718
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,120
putting

719
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,799
all sums together to to to build the

720
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,120
puzzle

721
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,559
what we found here is that uh normal

722
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,919
cretaceous super crown

723
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:55,840
uh we found here

724
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,760
at northwestern uh james ross spacing

725
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
we found the centone companion boundary

726
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,240
there in within

727
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,360
alpha member we found this

728
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,080
uh c 33 r c

729
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,000
33 and reversion both in proximal and

730
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,919
distal phases of the basin

731
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,320
and and it's a this is a very good thing

732
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,880
because you have an extra correlation

733
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,519
tool

734
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,159
besides the ammonites and

735
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,360
we found the the companion restriction

736
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,679
boundary

737
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,559
somewhere here at the base of central

738
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,559
eclipse member

739
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
and and oh i'm sorry i forgot to say

740
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,640
this this

741
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,200
top call was was realized by tobin and

742
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,840
collaborators at

743
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,760
2012 it's not a part of my job

744
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,559
but what is striking here is that this

745
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,679
c31

746
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:51,120
cron is is too thick right

747
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:54,640
so so comparing we calculated

748
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,679
some sedimentary accumulation rates and

749
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,679
and and this c31

750
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,840
in thermal yields like five times the

751
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,919
the sedimentary accumulation rates than

752
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,480
the rest of the units

753
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,440
and it makes sense i mean those values

754
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
are

755
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,919
are within the reasonable values for for

756
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,880
these transitional marine environments

757
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,039
this

758
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,880
this stratigraphic inferible was

759
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,919
interpreted as as

760
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,960
delta deposits uh hustle

761
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,399
crack samsung actually it is a a forced

762
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,640
regression

763
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,519
sun package the positive probably in a

764
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,480
very

765
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,679
short amount of time and then estuarine

766
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,519
deposits so it is

767
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,880
reasonable but it's still like five

768
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,120
times the rest of the

769
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,120
of the calculated values so the

770
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,240
explanation we

771
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,519
we we seeked for for this

772
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,480
increase uh had to do with

773
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,039
uh at the time that there was closed the

774
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,399
black

775
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,080
uh roxburgh spacing in south america

776
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,760
and the antarctic peninsula and south

777
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,960
america were pretty much closer

778
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,840
than what they are today so we

779
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,760
believe that this uh increase of

780
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,279
sedimentary accumulation rates

781
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,640
uh has has something to do with

782
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,679
with um with an organic uplift

783
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,960
in the angus yeah that's because there

784
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,360
is this um

785
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,200
magazine is fallen thrust built and and

786
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,240
people that work there in theory

787
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,120
they have found several uplift pulses so

788
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,120
probably

789
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,039
that have something to do with the this

790
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,640
increase in sedimentary accumulation

791
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,720
rates

792
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,279
so these are the conclusions this is the

793
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,320
the chronostatiographic framework

794
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,840
that came out from magnetostratigraphy

795
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,159
so from sedimentary rates we

796
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,960
extrapolated the carnation centronium

797
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,279
boundary

798
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,519
to the hidden lake formation and

799
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,200
our centonian companion boundary agrees

800
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,519
pretty much with the with the ammonites

801
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,760
from olive oil

802
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,600
and the compendium restriction well it's

803
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,640
pretty much lower than both uh

804
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,480
ammonites and ionoceramides so that's

805
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,480
that's it thank you very much

806
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,840
thank you very much uh let's give

807
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,720
florencia a good

808
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,720
round of applause

809
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,119
thank you florencia okay i stopped

810
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,200
sharing now

811
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,960
i know leave it in case maybe people

812
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,480
have some questions

813
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,720
if that's okay yeah yeah no problem so

814
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,720
um

815
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,159
so there was a question by um

816
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,399
by lisa and i was regarding one of the

817
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,679
pictures that she posted

818
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:44,000
and and she asked if

819
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:46,079
a sample i think 79 is in situ

820
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,639
um i don't remember the name of the

821
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,000
formation but

822
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,000
so it is questionable one sample

823
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,119
yeah i realized that you you were

824
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
drilling um

825
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,720
concretions later it just looked like a

826
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,160
it wasn't

827
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,839
it was a little wobble right it

828
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,200
i was just curious how did you orient

829
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:11,040
these with magnetic compass presumably

830
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,960
compass and solar when we have sun

831
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:19,119
so this one or i think i know what

832
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,240
you meant first one where you showed

833
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,839
a drill it doesn't hurt this one yeah it

834
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,079
looks pretty wobble

835
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,079
realize if you're drilling concretions

836
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,400
and they probably are in situ

837
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,880
so i mean so no i i mean maybe

838
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
concretions moved when drilling but but

839
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,359
they

840
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,000
they were in place okay all right

841
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,440
yeah they were in place also i had one

842
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,160
more question if

843
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,079
um or comment uh and very nice

844
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,200
presentation by the way thank you

845
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,680
um for updating us on this i i

846
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,359
i feel pers that it's much more

847
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,839
convincing to show

848
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,040
an equal area project of all of the

849
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,359
directions

850
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,160
rather than all that rock mag stuff

851
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,079
because

852
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,440
um uh it tells you a lot more about the

853
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,280
reliability of

854
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,680
the directions which is what max lies on

855
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,640
than any of those other things so i just

856
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,280
thought you should

857
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,359
probably stick one there yeah well yeah

858
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,160
i mean i i do have them i didn't show

859
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,839
them because i

860
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,839
i felt like it didn't have time

861
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,599
all the other stuff which is really

862
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,640
irrelevant

863
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,960
okay okay so no no much

864
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,400
uh rug mag more directional data

865
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,400
because what's the rock mag tell you

866
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,720
yeah it doesn't do anything about the

867
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,800
directions

868
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,480
that's just the way between if you have

869
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,839
one time

870
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:54,320
so show us the equal area there they are

871
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:59,520
nice so and these are for the nor

872
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:03,280
west and these are for the southeast

873
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,720
and what happened in the southeast

874
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,400
is that when um including

875
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,320
cerro nevado it's not hill island data

876
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,839
it didn't pass the reversal test i mean

877
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
every everything has

878
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,240
the same polarity pretty much here

879
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,200
so what we did was treat

880
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,440
separately data from from cerro nevado

881
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,920
and

882
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,880
data from south east timbers and data

883
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,960
from norwest

884
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,200
and brussels and serenova island mean

885
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,160
direction was a little tilted

886
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,760
like rotating so that there is like

887
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,440
another

888
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,440
issue about directions here

889
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,880
so this is the the mean directions from

890
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,880
from many

891
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,760
you can measure this tilt right so

892
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,800
right so so this is our

893
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,079
direction and it was moved

894
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,079
so we compared it with the

895
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,480
dykes mean which is pretty white alpha

896
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,520
but

897
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,320
it was the data we have

898
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,760
so what we proposed it was in a

899
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,760
different paper

900
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,800
not in the magnetostratigraphy this is

901
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,720
these are other

902
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,040
myosin dykes data

903
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,520
is that there might be a rotation in

904
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,760
cervical

905
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,599
because the this separately the

906
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,839
distribution separately it makes

907
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,359
sense but when putting everything

908
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,839
together with the rest of some of this

909
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,520
data

910
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,680
it didn't so we had to separate

911
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,359
populations so this is

912
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,359
this is the directional data

913
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,000
i don't know if so why do you expect the

914
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,000
cretaceous

915
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,119
directions to be the same as the myosin

916
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,160
one

917
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,440
was that maybe i misunderstood you

918
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,680
oh because the first time we saw

919
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:11,520
this open direction i thought there

920
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:15,359
might have been a remagnitization

921
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,560
and i have something to do and

922
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:23,040
now i was just looking for some for

923
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:26,079
uh sources that had modified that

924
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,359
directions that were not a tectonic

925
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,640
rotation

926
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:36,560
but i didn't fight them so that's why

927
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,560
i think it is potato

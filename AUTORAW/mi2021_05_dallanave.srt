1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,160
the next talk which is eduardo davine

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,240
uh talking about testing the reliability

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,480
of sedimentary paleomagnetic dataset for

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,759
paleogeographic reconstructions

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,880
uh take it away can you hear me all

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,400
right

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,800
yeah i can't perfect so my last name is

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,199
i know sorry it's italian don't worry

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,199
sorry

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,439
i'm used to that so can you see my

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,200
screen

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
yeah we can perfect

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,399
let me just

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,120
yeah okay so i want to talk to you about

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
um

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,200
it's basically a paper just got just got

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,480
published a few weeks ago

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,039
and is yeah it's about how can we

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,879
possibly test the reliability of

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
sedimentary paramagnetic data set

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,600
because

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,039
i mean sediments for the temporal and

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,159
the spatial distribution are very

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,680
important for parallel geographic

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,640
reconstruction so we want to be sure

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,400
that

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
the data we use are reliable

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,400
and why

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,320
so for people that were listening to me

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
last year they made my remember that i

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,799
was talking about um

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:29,280
new caledonia so some sedimentary data

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
from new caledonia and they're very good

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,159
in terms of magnetostratigraphy

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,119
so the direction themselves are reliable

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
they appear reliable at least but we

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,600
have a problem

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
especially about the inclination

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,200
inclination is not fitting with the

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,720
expected one

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
and also we have something to say i

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
always say something about the

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,320
unresolved availability sustainability

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,520
so is there a way

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,079
to assess the reliability of this

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,200
data so the problems that really is not

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
purely theoretical

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,240
stuff from real data and

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,280
how do we do that we want to investigate

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
the effects of

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,399
finite strain on simulated distribution

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,399
and we see different cases

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
and then there's what do we learn from

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
that what we see in the end so

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
it's just to see the outline of the

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,800
presentation

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,800
so it's just a bit off let me just set

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
up

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
uh the frame the geographic frame new

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,000
caledonia is in the

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
is a small island in the southwest

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,640
pacific so it's a

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
it's a portion of the norfolk reach so

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
all these

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,000
continent that you see here is called

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,599
zealandia and it's mostly submerged

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,720
but it's quite important for

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,800
understanding the dynamics of the

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
subduction initiate initiation of the

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,760
pacific play beneath the australian

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
plane so

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
since there is no much cropping out so

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,280
you either go and read as we did

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
with iodp expedition or you study

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
whatever

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,800
is cropping up and new caledonia is just

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,400
one of the few places where you can

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,360
study these sediments and

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,120
there is a section in particular in the

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
northern part of the nile of the island

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,599
with this this

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,920
transition between pelagic uh microsoft

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
carbonate sedimentary to a summary

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,400
plateau

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,239
to turbidites and it's this transition

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,599
is important in terms of the

87
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,799
regional geology and evolution

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,440
but if we focus on the lower part of the

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,599
section we have a beautiful data set

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
there is also some extra slides if you

91
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
want with some zyder

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,560
so you can show you can see them so we

93
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,560
have reversals we have very

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,280
consistent declination inclination

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,000
and the age model is quite clear so the

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
age is about

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,439
48 million of years ago around this age

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
and

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,840
so the data itself it does look reliable

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,040
especially if we take the direction we

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,879
don't take the direction from the

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
turbidites because they're not as good

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,040
as the lower part so we just want to

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,159
focus with a good data set and we have a

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,120
total of

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,519
88 i didn't put the number here but 88

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,400
directions

108
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
positive reversal test we use a

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,919
bootstrap approach

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,680
other than the normal the traditional

111
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,720
reversal tests usually

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
they um they assume that the directions

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
are

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,080
fissure distributed that's not always

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,320
the case

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,759
so with this bootstrap approach i'm not

117
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,520
going through the details but you

118
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,280
overcome this limitation

119
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,240
but the reversal test is positive and

120
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,639
we can see here that we have the data

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,040
set with the bed in implant

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,479
if we if we look at the data set in tilt

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,280
the corrected

124
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,759
coordinates just look at the blue one so

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
it's

126
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,320
the blue reference line they're clearly

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,360
more the inclination is higher it's a

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
lot higher like

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,479
something about 10 degrees other than

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,440
the one that we expect calculated from

131
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,240
the compilation of thor's week

132
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,919
and but we also know that there is a we

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
measure the unexotic magnetic

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,639
sustainability and

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,080
it's not um sedimentary

136
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,560
so if you look at the the plane

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,320
that lie between k1 and k2 is not

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,240
coincided with the sedimentary place so

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
that is clearly like something that ring

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
about

141
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,320
in terms of the reliability of the data

142
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
in terms of polygeography that's what we

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,960
see so this is new caledonia this

144
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,520
paramagnetic

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,360
is rotated compared to the the position

146
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,960
that we would expect but we know that

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,240
because nucalidon itself

148
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,800
is rotated so it fits with the

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
with a structural frame or sorry but the

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
inclination

151
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,800
is so the paramagnetic pole is clearly

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,479
off

153
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
is also true that the compilation of

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,400
tarvy tosvig used

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,400
data from other continents mostly

156
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,199
there's only one entry which is

157
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,280
within this time window all the other

158
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,160
data are coming from other continents

159
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,840
and they go through multiple rotations

160
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
and this is the parallel latitude that

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
we calculate with our data this is the

162
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,199
palu geographic

163
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,160
and global reconstruction let's say and

164
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
it's clearly off

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,759
so where is the problem

166
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,400
is the problem in the compilation or in

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,400
our data

168
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,240
we know that uh yeah there is like a

169
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
kind of fresh

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
regional compression but the the

171
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,440
straight are not heavily folded

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,319
so there's no indication of like heavily

173
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,639
the full menstruator that you can like

174
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,720
assume that the data are not reliable

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
so if you look at the literature there

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
are different phenomena that could

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
deviate your directions from the

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,319
original position the first one

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
the well-known one is the inclination

180
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,800
flattening

181
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,720
and if we measure the susceptibility of

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,639
the it's out of your society in this

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,000
condition we would have a

184
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,720
an oblate tensor and then as

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,360
we start deforming the straighter a bit

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,800
more we can imagine no cell compression

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,000
folding direction pointing to the north

188
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,280
we start having different um

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,759
fabrics like the weak cleavage fabric

190
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,960
will result in a anisotropic magnetic

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
stability

192
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,759
prolate in shape and then the

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,759
more extreme condition with short

194
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,240
cleavage strong cleavage and we would

195
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,880
have a

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
triaxial and this is the theoretical

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,479
evolution of the inclination that is

198
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,880
being published in some some old papers

199
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,160
so you could have either uh depending on

200
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,080
the flag on the

201
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,199
limb of the four you are you could have

202
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,160
shallowing or sleeping

203
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,080
so now uh we know and andy was talking

204
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,360
about that before the

205
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,960
the direction distribution uh we know

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,879
that they're not fisheries but they

207
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
they're a bit more complex so one of the

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,960
models people

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,560
put forward in the last few years is a

210
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,479
tko3

211
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,639
one of the assumption is that the vgps

212
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,800
are circular and that results in a

213
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,240
specific side the direction are not

214
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,479
circular but they are

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,360
elliptical and the elongation is

216
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,199
calculated

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,400
using the ratio between these two

218
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,280
eigenvalues so we simulated a saw um

219
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,240
a set of directions for different

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,120
latitude

221
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
they are drawn accordingly to this model

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,039
so

223
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,919
in this case we have the inclination

224
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,599
here and the elongation

225
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,479
and we see that it varies depending on

226
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,039
the inclination which in turn depends on

227
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,959
the latitude

228
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,479
and this method has been applied in the

229
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,000
past for

230
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
correcting for the inclination

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,440
flattening for example

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,720
so we gradually can uh increase this the

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,120
inclination of a set of direction uh

234
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,399
and the elongation vary until across the

235
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,880
expected values

236
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,080
so this for example is the same data set

237
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
as b correct

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,320
using this idea for inclination

239
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,000
flattening

240
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,600
so what we did is try to figure out how

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
not just inclination flattening but

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,920
other mechanisms could change

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,080
the shape of the distribution so we

244
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,360
started with a circular distribution for

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
two reasons

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,880
it's easier to visualize and

247
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,040
second is not necessarily far away from

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,519
the reality because if we sample

249
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,560
one single strata we are not expecting

250
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,399
to ever image averaging out the

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,480
circular variations so we would have a

252
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,959
fisherian distribution which is not

253
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,160
far away from a circle so we applied

254
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,560
different scenarios

255
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,640
to this circuit distribution which is

256
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,440
inclination of 50 degrees

257
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,279
and radius of 30 degrees we applied

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,959
first a flattening

259
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:46,160
and then just a pure shear

260
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,360
simulation and what we see for example

261
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,120
in this this

262
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
this is the gradient diagram where we

263
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,959
see the inclination and the elongation

264
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,399
this orange area is the area where you

265
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,399
would have

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
directions that are only affected by

267
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
inclination flattening

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,079
so they are potentially they potentially

269
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,120
can be corrected with

270
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,480
the method that we saw before

271
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
everything that falls here is not

272
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
reliable so it's clearly affected by

273
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,279
some problem

274
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,839
and yeah what we see is that when you

275
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,279
apply

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,200
a pure shear we immediately jump

277
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,920
to condition that is not realistic

278
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,720
anymore but it's not entirely released

279
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
so we wanted to we know that we also

280
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
have folding

281
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
so what we have to do is also apply a

282
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,839
folding to the data

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,279
what we do is just apply a minimum

284
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,200
tilting of the strata

285
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,480
and then we apply the pure shear

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,920
to both the direction and the bedding

287
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,839
and we get into a situation that is um

288
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,959
very similar to the one predicted by the

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
model

290
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,240
that we saw before so we can have either

291
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,160
depending on the limbs

292
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
on the fold that we found ourselves we

293
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,120
could have shallowing

294
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,560
or steepening it's very interesting that

295
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,160
this problem

296
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,399
is higher when we have a

297
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,320
pursuit a compression let's say that

298
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,240
it's not parallel to the declination

299
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
so it's affecting the shape of the

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,200
distribution a lot more but more

301
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,279
importantly

302
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,640
we don't have an elongation that is

303
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,680
neither parallel

304
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,640
nor perpendicular to the average

305
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,959
declination

306
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,760
but it's crooked and you can see that

307
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,800
from here

308
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,800
so the ellipticity is reflecting the

309
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,560
shape of the distribution

310
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,640
and that because that's what we expect

311
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
either from the model or for

312
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,720
the data that are just affected by

313
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
inclination flattening

314
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
either parallel or perpendicular when

315
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,000
it's not there is clearly something

316
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,079
something else affecting the data

317
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,240
after that okay we decided to work on

318
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,320
the generator the simulated data set to

319
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,920
see something a bit more

320
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,800
realistic in the first case we did we

321
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,839
applied again

322
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,920
just a pure shear without tilting

323
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,440
which is not entirely realistic i know

324
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,600
but is uh

325
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,279
it shows very well how the shape of the

326
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
distribution change

327
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,720
and one of the things that we can see is

328
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,120
that as soon as

329
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
we have an angle between the the

330
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,680
compression let's say

331
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,639
and the declination the directions

332
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,880
immediately jump

333
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,760
into distribution shapes that are not

334
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,079
acceptable

335
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
so they don't go we have some situation

336
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
where we can have something that is

337
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,680
falling into this

338
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,320
sedimentary kind of state

339
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,760
so increasing flattening state but in

340
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,680
most of the case

341
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,360
when you have an angle not even that one

342
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
there's a few degrees

343
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,880
you jump straight to directions

344
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,880
distribution that are not reliable

345
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,519
but we know that it's not entirely

346
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,519
realistic so we decided to do

347
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,360
just for two distribution 10 degrees of

348
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
poly latitude simulation simulated

349
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,480
latitude and 40 degrees

350
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,639
the series of events that could could

351
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,600
happen in reality so we apply first a

352
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,880
complex

353
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,760
compaction flattening of 0.6 and put it

354
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,639
here but i saw the standard let's say

355
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,240
sedimentary

356
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,040
flattening and then the possible weak

357
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,839
cleavage

358
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,320
and strong cleavage in both limbs of the

359
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,519
fold

360
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,040
and see what happen and

361
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,440
these the the red and the pink

362
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,639
um ellipses are the original

363
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
distribution they are lie

364
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,600
on the expected and we can see that when

365
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,279
we are so here

366
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,360
we can now go through all the diagrams

367
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
and photo but we can see basically this

368
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,040
is the

369
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
weak cleavage state the strong cleavage

370
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,920
stay

371
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,959
the front limb and the back lean and

372
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,600
they all create

373
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:50,800
different situations but

374
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,440
yeah we could see them when we apply um

375
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,440
like strong deformation they generally

376
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,279
jump over to the situation it's not

377
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,360
possible to correct anymore

378
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:05,120
and this is a lot stronger again

379
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,079
when we apply um stress let's say

380
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,680
finite strain there is no parallel to

381
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,519
the declination which is a very likely

382
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,079
situation i would say

383
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,320
and all the distribution you can say you

384
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,120
can see they jump immediately to shapes

385
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,880
that are not realistic with this model

386
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
i'm talking about this mod

387
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,560
and one of the thing is again the

388
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,560
elongation is crooked

389
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,600
so it's not it's not parallel to the

390
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,240
declination

391
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,959
as we would expect so this could be also

392
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,079
used

393
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,399
as a reliable reliability index so that

394
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,240
the

395
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
the elongation in this diagram is

396
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,199
represented by the dotted circle

397
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,040
where in some cases like for example is

398
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,519
passing through the center

399
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,399
and that will be parallel with the

400
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,440
declination

401
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,440
some other cases not clearly

402
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
so going back to our data

403
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,160
can we apply this kind of uh theory to

404
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,279
this so what we did is just so uh we we

405
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,079
say we have

406
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,320
88 direction which is not a lot this is

407
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
a

408
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,519
reasonable number but it's not like um

409
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,839
the problem is i want to calculate

410
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,480
confidence confidence margin

411
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,000
and the only way at least the one i know

412
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,560
is about bootstrap

413
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,600
using booster and we can see that this

414
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,720
is a 90

415
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,199
confident boundary it's quite wide but

416
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,759
still

417
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:32,720
um from the complete data set

418
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
we also filter some direction that i had

419
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,120
some criteria

420
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,160
i can yeah i can show you maybe like uh

421
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,839
if you want

422
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,839
so it's mostly

423
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,639
yeah and what we see is the the complete

424
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,320
data set

425
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,000
it looks reliable if we feel that the

426
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
data is a bit less reliable

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and then we try using the direction from

428
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,040
the

429
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,040
magnetic susceptibility tensor to

430
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
unstrain the direction to see what

431
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,600
happens

432
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,079
if we apply an unstrained technique

433
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,920
this direction and what we see is that

434
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,920
we entered the condition

435
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,120
of elongation parallel to the

436
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
declination

437
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
with very similar results but still we

438
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,839
are far from the

439
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,839
expected inclination which is this one

440
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
so um

441
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,320
final remarks we're still in a pico

442
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,000
about this direction because we we are

443
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,560
more inclined to consider

444
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
the the direction not reliable because

445
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,519
of the

446
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,759
ams measurement something that i want to

447
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,639
outline without the unexpected magnetic

448
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,880
sustainability

449
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,079
this dataset will look reliable so

450
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,279
there's something that

451
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,639
should be always presented when we use

452
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,839
the direction for parallel geographic

453
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,360
reconstruction

454
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
and that should be done together with

455
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,360
adequate um with a

456
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,320
proper number of direction normally a

457
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,120
hundred

458
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,039
it's considered and some other standard

459
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,559
reliability tests like the usual

460
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,480
fault test and and we recommend also to

461
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,760
you to do also the distribution shape

462
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
analysis

463
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,400
and with new caledonia it's probably we

464
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,799
need more data from the area because

465
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,880
all the data are rotated so yeah they

466
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,799
are probably more correct this one even

467
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,839
if they are rotated but we are still in

468
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,360
a situation where

469
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,960
there's no data from the area

470
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,720
and what about the limitation of this

471
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
method you need a lot of direction to

472
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,000
have

473
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,160
nice confidence margin and

474
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,679
we actually don't know i think if this

475
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,559
model is valid

476
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,559
always so

477
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,840
that's it i always finish with a picture

478
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
from new caledonia

479
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,960
oh thank you very much has anyone got

480
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,559
any questions yes

481
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:06,000
go forward hi that's great talk thanks

482
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,480
um i was wondering there's i i've also

483
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
had some

484
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
some strange inclinations in the eu

485
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,559
scene and i think they're reported for

486
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,080
many parts in the in its ethium belt

487
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
do you think that maybe it has something

488
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,760
to do with that my inclinations are

489
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,919
always very shallow and they're

490
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
in volcanic rocks and i think they find

491
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,799
them from

492
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,520
from spain all the way to the east

493
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,440
i was wondering if you have any idea ah

494
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
so you may

495
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
i have a kind of blood memory in the

496
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
past that read some paper that i say in

497
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,600
the

498
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
in the some part of the cenozoic maybe

499
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,520
the three was not that polar at least

500
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,200
yeah i think there's a paper of westfall

501
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,400
and also of kanye that's

502
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,320
um speculate about this but i yeah yeah

503
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,039
because this thing is quite new so it's

504
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,039
uh

505
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,280
yeah it would be interesting to check

506
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,280
that

507
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,520
i i have no answer right now so yeah no

508
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,520
worries

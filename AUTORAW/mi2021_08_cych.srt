1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
okay excellent so um hi

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,919
i'm brendan i'm a phd student at the

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,559
university of california san diego

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,080
um and i'm going to give a talk on

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,440
something a bit different today

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,920
which is kind of looking at the

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,640
statistics of pillow intensity

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
and how to sort of perhaps we can we can

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,039
move forward with

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,640
um how we're analyzing paleo intensity

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
experiments i think a few of you may

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,560
have seen

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,519
a version of this presentation um sort

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
of an earlier

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,280
version of this method agu a year ago or

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,079
a couple years ago

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
and it's changed a fair bit since then

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
and

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
some of the sort of contribution from

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,360
that has come from my second author

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,039
matty mooresfeld

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,440
who is sort of a statistician um

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,760
predominantly and so um he's been

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,199
helping me out a lot with this method

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,480
um so um

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,120
so what we're looking at is we're

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,039
looking at atelier experiments

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,280
and i've just given two examples of sort

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
of ra plots from talia experiments so

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
the idea is

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,119
that um we are demagnetizing the

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,280
specimen by heating it to temperature

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,920
and cooling it in zero fields

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
and giving it a magnetization by heating

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
it and

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,439
cooling it in a known lab field and the

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,119
ratio of those two magnetizations

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,640
um should give us uh the ratio of the

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,240
two fields

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
um and you can see that it should obey

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,520
this linear relationship

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
um so i've given two examples here one

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
over sort of an experiment that's done

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
reasonably well

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
and one of an experiment that's uh not

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
done well at all

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,640
um and this is because probably in this

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,079
case um there's been an alteration of

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,079
the material

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,840
um but um

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,200
and so if you try to estimate using this

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
you'll get a very biased estimate of

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,399
paleo intensity another case where this

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,840
can happen

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,520
um is where you have um

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
what's known as sort of a curved or a

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,640
too slow-powered plot

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,399
um i think there's a lot of literature

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,320
now that looks at these and says that

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,399
sort of doing this kind of an estimate

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,000
where you're taking the sort of low

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
temperature slope of a plot that looks

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,400
like this

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,319
can cause you a biased estimate and

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,280
this this is a problem um because

66
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,200
you have uh sort of the whole point of

67
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
this plot is to be able to choose linear

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,480
segments

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,520
and so if you can't do that you're

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,360
you're in trouble

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
and so what we do is we use selection

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,720
criteria um which is sort of

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,640
statistics about these ri plot data and

74
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,239
other data to do with the experiment

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,080
to sort of exclude results that we

76
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,959
believe to be biased this could be a

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
result that gets

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,160
excluded um

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,680
but this is problematic because it's

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
sort of subjective so i'm going to show

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
you sort of the

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
three examples of plots like these and

83
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,080
these are all plots where this sort of

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
curvature

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
uh could be an issue and could lead to

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,200
sort of a

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,519
biased paleo intensity results um

88
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,440
and whether it's appropriate to sort of

89
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,040
select these parts of the ri plots to do

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,959
analysis is not always

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,959
clear and i think different labs using

92
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,319
different sets of criteria

93
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,440
might exclude or might accept these

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,159
specimens depending on sort of who you

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
ask

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,680
so where do we put the cut off is this

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,879
sort of very subjective uh

98
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360
problem um and so this is something that

99
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
sort of

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,440
i was very frustrated by when i i've

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
been doing these experiments so

102
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,120
i wanted to i wanted to perhaps find

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
something that um

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
that did this in a slightly different

105
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,400
way so

106
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,760
sort of the main idea behind this is

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
that for any

108
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,920
specimen level uh estimate so that's

109
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,959
this b specimen

110
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,360
um you will have something that looks

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
like

112
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
the ancient fields plus some amount of

113
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
bias

114
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,840
and some amount of noise right and so if

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
we knew what this was then we could

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
always calculate the paleo intensity

117
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,959
right just by measuring

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,200
several specimens because then you know

119
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,519
this this would get averaged out

120
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
um but what we do is we use selection

121
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
criteria to kind of exclude things

122
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
except where this is close to zero

123
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,239
right and so then we don't really have

124
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,120
to worry about this term um

125
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,959
but by doing that we're kind of saying

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,359
that the selection criteria are sort of

127
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
a

128
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,960
predictor of what the bias will be right

129
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,919
so if you were doing this in a sort of

130
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,840
machine learning

131
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,360
type way you just take a load of

132
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,919
selection criteria

133
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,000
you'd model the bias as a function of

134
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,600
those selection criteria

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,440
and then you would um

136
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
use that to try and sort of find this

137
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,080
function and then you know correct back

138
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,360
to

139
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,240
the sort of good values of the selection

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,000
criteria

141
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
if that makes sense um but the issue

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,960
with that is that

143
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,960
we generally don't have very many

144
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,960
specimens at a site level

145
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
and we have a lot of selection criteria

146
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,560
that people use

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,720
and they're sort of mostly um

148
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
empirically based or

149
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
there's not sort of a really good

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
understanding of what that relationship

151
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,479
would be

152
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,759
so it's difficult to um come up with

153
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,080
something that wouldn't have sort of

154
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,919
very

155
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
big uncertainties associated with it

156
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,360
it's a bit too complicated for the

157
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,520
number of specimens that we have

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,440
but one predictor that i wanted to look

159
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,400
at was this sort of curvature

160
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,360
um and so the idea with this is that

161
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
these are data

162
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,440
where someone gave magnetite powders of

163
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,440
known grain sizes

164
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,039
that sort of increase in coarseness as

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
you go to the right

166
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
um and gave them a magnetization and

167
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
then did this experiment on them and you

168
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,960
can see that this sort of curvature

169
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,400
increases and also if you take sort of

170
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,280
what's what's to been done here is to

171
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,759
take the

172
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
sort of uh estimate just using all of

173
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,880
these

174
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,720
um points so it's not it's fitting a

175
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
line to everything but also the total

176
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
trm

177
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,199
does this as well you'll notice if you

178
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,919
look at the numbers here

179
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,720
that um your estimate effectively

180
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
becomes

181
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,639
um more biased as your curvature

182
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,880
increases right

183
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,880
um and the curvature criterion is sort

184
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,840
of a useful one because uh greg

185
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
patterson

186
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,720
in his 2011 paper um when he came up

187
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
with this kind of said that it has sort

188
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,479
of a reasonable correlation with the

189
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,280
grain size in these powders

190
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,560
so this is kind of an interesting thing

191
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,759
that we can maybe

192
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,319
use to predict things

193
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,960
so the way that i'm doing this is i'm

194
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,639
actually putting an uncertainty on it

195
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
so i use bayesian statistics to

196
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,680
calculate the curvature with uncertainty

197
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,639
i'm not going to go

198
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
really deep into the statistics today um

199
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
but

200
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,080
you can talk to me about that if you

201
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
want to um

202
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,280
basically the idea is that um we're

203
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
calculating so this is a circle fit to

204
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
the data

205
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,479
um and this is the curvature criterion

206
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
which is one over the radius with

207
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,720
direction

208
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,160
so if it's um curved this way if it's a

209
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
perfectly straight line at zero if it's

210
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,280
sort of curved this way it becomes a

211
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,840
higher curvature

212
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,039
so the k becomes more positive and if

213
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,680
it's curved this way

214
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,639
k becomes more negative and then to

215
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,440
calculate sort of a slope for a circle

216
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,840
the idea is that i actually sort of get

217
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
like

218
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,840
something that's in between the highest

219
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,400
slope and the lowest slope

220
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,039
um which is i use a tangent to the

221
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,599
circle

222
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,680
at the point that the line connecting

223
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,759
the origin and circle center intersects

224
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,319
and that seems like a really weird

225
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,280
um thing to use but it's actually quite

226
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
useful

227
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
uh as i'll demonstrate and it gives you

228
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,720
a slope in between the upper and lower

229
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,880
slopes and the idea there was

230
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,639
i was looking to see if that gave you

231
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
sort of a better or an unbiased estimate

232
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,520
and it doesn't

233
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,039
but um it's something that sort of

234
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,680
averages out so it's not

235
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,360
it's not using that sort of is it this

236
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,599
part or is it this part

237
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,879
so here's an example of not such a good

238
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,560
thing where potentially there's some

239
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,840
more stuff going wrong than curvature

240
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,720
but you can see that this sort of

241
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,680
average slope

242
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,879
is uh is well an example of that the

243
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,080
median value of that

244
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,800
looks like this and

245
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,599
the circle fit looks like this i should

246
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,319
mention that the

247
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,800
the circle fits are done by scaling the

248
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,039
data

249
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,440
first to avoid the issue

250
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,199
of if you have you know like a different

251
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,759
uh lab field used

252
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
um you would get a different curvature

253
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
so

254
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,759
uh they're scaled so that the it's

255
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,759
always

256
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,440
on the sort of zero one zero one scale

257
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,039
and then i unscale the slope of this

258
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,879
line so sort of some weird stuff going

259
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,000
there but you can see that in this case

260
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,759
you know you've got something that's

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
definitely not linear and there's no

262
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,919
overlap with linear here

263
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
in this probability distribution of the

264
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,159
curvature

265
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,080
um and then this is another example so

266
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,560
the thing about this one is that you can

267
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
also

268
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,839
you know take an interpretation where

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,399
you don't take the whole line

270
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,399
and the useful thing that's um that's

271
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,600
going on here is that because i've said

272
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
okay this thing has

273
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
thermo chemical alteration because this

274
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
uh

275
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
ptrm check which is a repeat of this

276
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,080
measurement

277
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,680
fails um what's going on here as i say

278
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,279
okay so you can only take this part of

279
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
the line and this part definitely isn't

280
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,880
giving us any useful information

281
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
and so what that does is it causes sort

282
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,320
of an uncertainty about

283
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
what the curvature of the rest of this

284
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,040
plot looks like

285
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,040
and so it sort of gives you a much

286
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,160
larger uncertainty in the curvature so

287
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
it sort of

288
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
helps with that idea we normally use you

289
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,160
know criteria that say well this line

290
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
has to be a certain length

291
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
but this sort of incorporates the

292
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,839
uncertainty by only picking a small part

293
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
of this line automatically

294
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,680
um just by just by doing this so this

295
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
kind of statist these kind of statistics

296
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,600
are quite useful in

297
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,080
their ability to calculate uncertainties

298
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
so then

299
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,680
you know at a site level how do we how

300
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,279
do we tie this all together so i'm just

301
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,200
going to show you a plot of what happens

302
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,279
if you calculate these curvatures versus

303
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,200
these uncertainties at a site level

304
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,440
you can see that um in this case the

305
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,360
the red line is the expected value of

306
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,279
the field at this site so these are all

307
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,720
specimens um from uh hawaiian lava flow

308
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,000
from i think it's the hawaii 1935 flow

309
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,320
and you can see that the things that

310
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,640
have low curvature um

311
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,720
as you'd expect have you know a sort of

312
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
an unbiased estimate of this

313
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
and then the things that have curvature

314
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,200
you know the that sort of average slope

315
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,720
that we calculate

316
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,360
is uh off um and you can see that

317
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,200
um probably the most appropriate model

318
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
to fit in this case to sort of these

319
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
data is you could you can sort of

320
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,600
imagine fitting a line through this

321
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,640
there's obviously this sort of outlier

322
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
here

323
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,680
um but you can sort of imagine doing

324
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,279
that right and

325
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,120
for the most part it would fit

326
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,120
reasonably well the majority of these

327
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
data so then instead of having that bias

328
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
term

329
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,360
you can say that you know this is sort

330
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,399
of a linear function of the curvature so

331
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
it's some constant

332
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,320
times the curvature plus noise the

333
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,760
specimen intensities

334
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,760
um and so i hope everyone

335
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,519
hope everyone kind of has kind of

336
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,399
understands this so basically applausing

337
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,399
curvature here

338
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,600
on this axis versus intensity on this

339
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
axis and so

340
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,959
things that have you know higher

341
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
curvature sort of becoming more biased

342
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,920
and we're fitting

343
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,200
fitting a linear fit to that and in that

344
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,959
case the

345
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,880
intercept basically the sort of

346
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,760
uncertainty on this intercepts

347
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,600
here um becomes the uncertainty on our

348
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,640
paleo intensity at the site

349
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
now there's no reason why this should be

350
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
linear

351
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,760
um it's completely empirical but for

352
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
whatever reason it does seem to hold

353
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,920
fairly well for a lot of sites that you

354
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,480
see this kind of linear trend

355
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
um in sort of intensity versus curvature

356
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
when you

357
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,640
when you measure it sort of the way that

358
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,240
i'm doing so i think this is this is

359
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,680
something very interesting why

360
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,279
why do you have this and you may say

361
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
okay well there's there's this here but

362
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,680
i'll kind of show you why

363
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
why this is not a problem in a second so

364
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
and

365
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,160
that's the reason why we're calculating

366
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,240
uncertainties on these things by the way

367
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,160
so um this is a complicated figure so

368
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,839
effectively what happens is when we fit

369
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,720
a line to these things

370
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,279
uh i fit both the sort of circle fits

371
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,880
and the line fits at the same time

372
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,560
and so what happens is that these

373
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,959
probability distributions

374
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,000
get modified so there's a sort of a

375
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,079
trade-off between

376
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
fitting the circle and fitting the line

377
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,079
here

378
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,200
um and so you can see that particularly

379
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,040
for

380
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,480
this specimen and e where we're fitting

381
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,519
a circle here

382
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,399
um the curvature gets modified to be

383
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,000
slightly less

384
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,920
and to be honest with you this specimen

385
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,079
is probably just altering so it's not

386
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,040
it's not really a curvature issue in

387
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,880
this case

388
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,240
but this really shouldn't be deciding

389
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,800
what our what our sort of

390
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,240
intensity looks like and so it's getting

391
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
modified because

392
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,760
these things have sort of more more

393
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,320
power here

394
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,959
so instead of you know selecting this

395
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
thing out

396
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,560
it's just not really uh informing

397
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,560
anything

398
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,480
when compared to sort of these data

399
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
which are really close to the intercepts

400
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,240
and also have smaller uncertainties

401
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,240
and you can see that sort of reflected

402
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,320
here that this thing with a linear

403
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,920
fit is pretty much unchanged um and so

404
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,480
basically there's there's this sort of

405
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,160
idea that um

406
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,079
that things that sort of fit this model

407
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,480
better will will be affecting

408
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,120
you know what what the answer looks like

409
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
better

410
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,040
when you have enough specimens so i'm

411
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,760
just going to give you some examples

412
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,839
of um plots where we've done this at a

413
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,959
site level and you can see that it's not

414
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,839
really linear for a lot of things but um

415
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,920
you know it is and and the red line in

416
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,760
all cases is the expected field value

417
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,519
for these historical flows

418
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
and you can see that um actually

419
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,959
probably one of the more interesting

420
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,800
ones here is this site where

421
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,160
we've got a pretty big uncertainty on

422
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
the slope here

423
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,760
um but you can see that um

424
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,240
these specimens here some of which are

425
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,760
sort of accepted

426
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,959
are biased low

427
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,639
um our method is less affected by this

428
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,079
than just putting a cut off sort of

429
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,600
somewhere here right depending on where

430
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,760
you put that cut off

431
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,639
um you're going to get sort of an answer

432
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,199
that might be

433
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,639
slightly biased low even even just by

434
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,959
these things so

435
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,959
um it's kind of interesting that this

436
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,079
this sort of works in cases where

437
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,160
even where you've got um you know

438
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,279
not not as many things that are really

439
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,199
close

440
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,800
um but these are the sort of um

441
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,320
probability distributions and i should

442
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
say these lines are also this is all

443
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,959
done through a sort of monte carlo

444
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,560
method so

445
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,160
these are all sampled from the

446
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,760
probability distribution and so

447
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
if you take enough samples you sort of

448
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
approximate this probability

449
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,480
distribution and that's what these

450
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,120
histograms are showing here um

451
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,760
and these black bars are 95 credible

452
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
intervals

453
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,639
um on this so they're sort of the 2.5

454
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,920
and 97.5

455
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,800
percentile of these uh samples

456
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,000
um so that's nice we can use this and

457
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,480
basically without

458
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,120
excluding these data we can we can get

459
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,480
these uh probability distributions

460
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,600
um that are sort of unbiased um

461
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,760
so to test this i applied this to a set

462
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,279
of specimens from sort of 30 sites where

463
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,440
the field was known

464
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,800
and as an analysis as sort of a very

465
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,480
broad thing i just used all the

466
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,399
temperature steps from every specimen so

467
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,199
i didn't i didn't choose things based on

468
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,360
that being

469
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,959
um you know alteration or something like

470
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,240
that i just did a very sort of

471
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,639
um naive kind of look at this

472
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,279
and i compared the results to secret

473
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,720
which is

474
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,360
defined in the paper that uh cromwell

475
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,480
paper

476
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,880
that i've been showing the data from and

477
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
uh greg patterson's modified version of

478
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
the picrit 03

479
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,720
selection criteria that don't include

480
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,199
this curvature parameter

481
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,880
um and so sites the the idea here is

482
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,480
that basically the number of specimens

483
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,680
in the site is increasing

484
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,000
from left to right so oh and i should

485
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
say that i did select out some specimens

486
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,880
where the demagnetization wasn't

487
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,399
completed there is sort of a

488
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,680
methodological reason for that but the

489
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,600
main reason i did that

490
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,279
um uh that i

491
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,639
had some uh stuff where the demand size

492
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,000
the experiments hadn't been completed

493
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,959
yet and i didn't want to include those

494
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,040
ones

495
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,959
so um i

496
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,560
didn't have those but that is very few

497
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,320
specimens that end up actually getting

498
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,079
selected out because mostly people

499
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,920
complete their experiments

500
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,839
um in these papers um so

501
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,440
sites with um sort of small number of

502
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
specimens in any case have

503
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
large uncertainties and that's because

504
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
there's sort of a lot of moving parts in

505
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,959
this model and so you need

506
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,360
about i would say five or six specimens

507
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,600
to start getting sort of a reasonable

508
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,040
um uncertainty in your results you can

509
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
see that this one has three and it has

510
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
an

511
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,120
okay uncertainty but it's probably you

512
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,040
know more than people would like

513
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,040
this is the normalized intensity i

514
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,399
should say so this is the expected value

515
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
is the red line and then this is sort of

516
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
the

517
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,600
ratio of the value to the expected value

518
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,560
and these are 95

519
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,800
confidence intervals so so for the

520
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
selection criteria it's just a two sigma

521
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,880
interval

522
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,240
and then for our method it's that 95

523
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,320
confidence interval what i was showing

524
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,079
you before um

525
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,199
and the shaded area is uh plus or minus

526
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,799
three microtesla

527
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,799
in all cases so you get an idea sort of

528
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,079
the absolute deviation as well

529
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,079
and you can see that sort of in most

530
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,120
cases we get a very similar result to

531
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,480
the secret

532
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,240
uh criteria and

533
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,160
you can see that um as you sort of

534
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
increase your number of specimens

535
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,919
actually um

536
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,799
my method starts to become more precise

537
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,200
than the secret method i think that

538
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
that's

539
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
um that's something to know and

540
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
basically the reason for that is that

541
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
it's like looking at a

542
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,720
uh standard error of the mean and these

543
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,440
are just sample standard deviations

544
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,000
um and you can see that for the pickered

545
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
stuff they

546
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,600
don't generally perform as well they're

547
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,240
generally you know more affected by

548
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,840
these biased results

549
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,360
so um i have another set from the other

550
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,280
15.

551
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,799
so in this case you can see that when we

552
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,559
get to sort of the high numbers of

553
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,679
specimens you'll notice that this high

554
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,039
precision thing

555
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,200
starts to get sort of more precise um in

556
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,280
some cases than we would expect so

557
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
the picture is not you know great

558
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,600
everywhere

559
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,000
um and the reason i think for this

560
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
is as i said before this is like a

561
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
standard error in the mean and so that

562
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,760
would also be

563
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,760
um inaccurate for these sites

564
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,559
um these three um in particular

565
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,799
these are yuji yamamoto papers where he

566
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,799
suggests that it's perhaps a tcrm

567
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,400
acquisition which causes a slight bias

568
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,400
in italian experiments and he says

569
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,679
that's why you should use his ltd sure

570
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,200
method

571
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,720
the other thing that he mentions in in

572
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
this paper in particular is actually

573
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,600
that there's there's an uncertainty in

574
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
the igrf field

575
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,280
um for some of these sites right which

576
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
is about to microtesla

577
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,559
and actually if you include that that

578
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,080
they do

579
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,720
you know sort of within confidence

580
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,480
overlap with our data so

581
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,679
sort of either of those could be invoked

582
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
here and you can see that there are sort

583
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,080
of some sites like this

584
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,080
msh site where um

585
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,000
we have sort of a lot of poor quality

586
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,760
data and it does sort of make

587
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,360
an inaccurate result in the end because

588
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,400
there's basically nothing good in there

589
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
and what's going on

590
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
wrong with this site is probably not

591
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,440
curvature

592
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,440
um but there's sort of a these are

593
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,720
imprecise with high numbers of specimens

594
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,919
so there's actually a way of sort of

595
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,039
telling that there's something wrong

596
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,600
with these sites

597
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,120
which i'm going to go into now so

598
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,640
basically the way that this looks this

599
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,559
is a plot of the sort of number of

600
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,480
specimens per site and then this is the

601
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,520
sort of width of that 95

602
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,520
credible interval as an estimate

603
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,960
uh of the paleo intensity and you can

604
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,880
see that um

605
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,240
basically this is this is a log scale so

606
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
these are like this is like 100

607
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,480
microtesla and this dashed line is 20

608
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,960
microtesla this is five specimens right

609
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,559
and so you can kind of see that as

610
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,679
things increase in their number of

611
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,760
specimens

612
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,600
they generally sort of get down to sort

613
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,640
of that full 95

614
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,120
confidence interval being uh less than

615
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
uh 10 microtesla which is you know if

616
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,840
you

617
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,320
if this was a normal distribution that

618
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,240
would be a standard deviation of 2.5

619
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,360
microtesla right for the sort of forward

620
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,840
the 95 confidence interval and these

621
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,480
the the coloration here i should say is

622
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,760
um

623
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,360
basically the the deviation from the

624
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,080
expected value

625
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,240
and so you can see that sort of these

626
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,039
things that despite having high numbers

627
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,360
of specimens

628
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,799
have a high deviation from the expected

629
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
value

630
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,559
also have high uncertainties with these

631
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,400
high numbers of specimens

632
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,240
sort of greater than 20 with more than

633
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,760
five which is sort of something that

634
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,679
i'm looking at some it's somewhere

635
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,120
around here right

636
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,400
and so this is kind of telling you that

637
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
there's something going wrong which is

638
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,400
that you keep measuring more things

639
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,159
but you're not really converging on a

640
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,320
very precise estimate

641
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
um so sort of the idea with the workflow

642
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,360
with this would be that you know you'd

643
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,640
start off here as you're measuring

644
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,480
specimens

645
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,480
and as you continue to measure more

646
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,559
things you get more precise until you

647
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
you know reach a sort of desired level

648
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,120
of precision

649
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,559
um and if you don't reach that desired

650
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,240
level of precision after a certain

651
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,840
number of specimens then you say well

652
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,240
there's something wrong with this site

653
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,320
um this this methodology isn't isn't

654
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,080
sort of what we need to do for this

655
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,600
um so sort of i guess the the advantages

656
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,320
of this is obviously you have this

657
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,679
workflow

658
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,440
uh where you could you don't need to

659
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
worry about sort of the numbers and

660
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,240
that the other thing is that it sort of

661
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,000
it propagates these uncertainties

662
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,600
um from the sort of um interpretations

663
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,440
that you make that are subjective

664
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,080
into um into your sort of site level

665
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,760
estimate

666
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,280
and so this means that it basically

667
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,000
accounts for sort of all those

668
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,880
selection criteria that are things that

669
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,799
are like

670
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,400
curvature obviously the curvature one

671
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,840
but also sort of length of line and sort

672
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,760
of scatter things

673
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,679
um it sort of incorporates that into the

674
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,240
the uncertainty of what the curvature

675
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,080
and therefore what the bias is

676
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,080
this method can't tell you which set of

677
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,960
temperature steps to use so sort of my

678
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,080
my suggestion there is that um you

679
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
shouldn't

680
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,320
pick your set of temperature steps based

681
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,360
on the sort of ra plot

682
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,440
in field zero field steps you can do it

683
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,440
based on things like ptrm checks which

684
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,640
are indicators of alteration

685
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,840
and you can probably do it based on um

686
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,679
direction um for this method because you

687
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,720
know if you have multiple components

688
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,400
then you should be able to

689
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,120
select things based on direction um

690
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,120
but uh you probably shouldn't do it just

691
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,840
based on what's curved or not because

692
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,360
then you

693
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,960
may be getting sort of you know your

694
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,480
uncertainty will blow up but you might

695
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
start to get things that are

696
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
that are biased in there um so sort of

697
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,080
the final part of this project is that

698
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,960
i'm sort of working on a

699
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,240
web-based dashboard that takes data sort

700
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
of formatted in

701
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,000
the magic format and you can process it

702
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
using this

703
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,559
method and so the aim is to make this uh

704
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,280
available sort of as the paper releases

705
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,039
um and then you can sort of just analyze

706
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,360
your data using this

707
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,159
um at this you know and so hopefully

708
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,360
this this will be going live you know

709
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,400
you i don't know exactly when but i want

710
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,159
to be submitting this

711
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,000
sort of within the next month sometime

712
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:23,120
so are there any questions

713
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,240
um imagine there will be

714
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:30,080
thank you very much yeah go ahead

715
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,440
hi brandon uh very nice talk and um the

716
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,280
yeah in principle this this sounds great

717
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,640
um i've got lots of questions about the

718
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
details of it but i'll try and restrict

719
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
it to

720
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,240
two so you mentioned overprints right at

721
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,559
the end there

722
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,120
or multiple components because i guess

723
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,600
you've only tested this on on zero age

724
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,679
rocks right which right yeah so not zero

725
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,159
yeah i tested this on historical things

726
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
yeah

727
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,520
there's there's a question of overprints

728
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,679
um

729
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,039
i just received um some data

730
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,679
that are um

731
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,600
that are archaea magnetic data that were

732
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,200
recorded in two different fields so i

733
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
think they're bricks that were fired

734
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,799
and then used in a furnace somewhere

735
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,080
else and so they they record two

736
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,120
different fields and so

737
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,919
i'm going to try this on those

738
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,520
but in theory because you can sort of

739
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,159
make that selection and you can make it

740
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,760
based on

741
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,840
direction right you you will still find

742
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,520
um an answer to that it's just that

743
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,159
because you've got a lower part of the

744
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,720
line your uncertainty blows up from that

745
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,559
so you you sort of with this method the

746
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,799
idea is that you want to make the best

747
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,279
interpretation of the data that you can

748
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,120
given the evidence you have but i would

749
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,520
argue that you probably don't want to do

750
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,960
that

751
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,799
on ri plot data alone unless they're

752
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
ptrm checks you want some sort of other

753
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,520
evidence that there's alteration or

754
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,559
there's another

755
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,679
another field now people might say that

756
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,000
um with vrm um

757
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
there is an issue because you know vrm

758
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,320
could be in a similar direction

759
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,840
and i guess i would argue there that you

760
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,600
could probably select out the

761
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
temperature steps according to sort of

762
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,919
the nail

763
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,919
theory of vrm if you have an idea about

764
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,080
how old these things are

765
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,559
um but you don't want to select things

766
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,600
out

767
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,200
um that have sort of a greater number of

768
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,039
temperature sets than that because then

769
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,799
what is that right if it's not if it's

770
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,080
not a nail theory there and then you're

771
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,320
getting into the realm of things that

772
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
you don't really understand and then

773
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,159
then there are some issues with that

774
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
sure okay but in principle you you

775
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,520
you'd expect this to be useful for much

776
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,480
older rocks as well

777
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,880
yes definitely yeah i have tested it on

778
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,000
some

779
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,840
of my results from hawaii which range

780
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,159
between sort of zero and five which are

781
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,000
not

782
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,400
you know that's old but they definitely

783
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,480
have over prints in some cases for the

784
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,919
or not overprints but vrms that are in a

785
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,679
different direction

786
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:57,039
um and um those

787
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:00,640
actually work um really well so

788
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,799
yeah all right so

789
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,039
can i follow up things sorry because you

790
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,360
mentioned ptrm checks there as well

791
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,440
the alteration so you're excluding parts

792
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,200
which you're saying are clearly

793
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,200
biased due to alteration um not in

794
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,320
the data that i've presented i just did

795
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,080
a really naive

796
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,679
uh fit to just the whole thing and it

797
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,400
still works right okay well

798
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,880
that's that's very boring for me because

799
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,559
um

800
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,919
because ptm checks can fail because of

801
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,480
md behavior right which is what you're

802
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,840
trying to

803
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,360
uh right yes something that

804
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,200
it's possible to look at and i don't

805
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,640
necessarily advocate for peter m checks

806
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,440
i mean you could you could look at you

807
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,559
know

808
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,919
something like uh bulk susceptibility um

809
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,240
after each measurement and stuff like

810
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,400
that and that might be a more

811
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,919
a more useful indicator i'm not i'm kind

812
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,000
of open to the idea of using other

813
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,679
things as an indicator for alteration

814
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,440
but i just think you need that evidence

815
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,080
of something being alteration

816
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
um and pcrm checks are probably more

817
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
likely to be that than

818
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,960
multi-domain effects i've got a couple

819
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,559
more questions

820
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,760
um who is that

821
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,520
sorry and win

822
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,880
like that's really nice talk brendan i

823
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,480
firstly i wouldn't get too hung up on

824
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,400
the mice and helen samples i know greg

825
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,640
will tell you that you know he

826
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,399
the success rate of those was pretty

827
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,480
close to zero so i you know

828
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,440
there's a lot of chemical alteration in

829
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,200
those samples

830
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,440
i was just kind of curious because i

831
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,120
know that andy and both greg have worked

832
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,799
on you know how many samples as a rule

833
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,919
of thumb should you be aiming to sample

834
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,120
in the field it's okay

835
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,279
you know coming back and saying you need

836
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,919
to keep measuring samples until

837
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,440
until you get to this optimum number or

838
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,320
behavior but when you're in the field

839
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,279
you don't know what you're going to get

840
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,640
so i mean how many

841
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,399
what would your sam what would you

842
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,600
suggest your sampling strategy in the

843
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,360
field should be for people how many

844
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,120
samples should they be collecting

845
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,240
per year right so so because um

846
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,600
yeah so so i guess for me this is not

847
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,799
this is not something that

848
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,480
i've been thinking about in that way

849
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,840
because it scripts what we do is we take

850
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,000
hand samples and then we use these small

851
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,000
chips to do

852
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,919
um hill intensity measurements so so

853
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
number of samples is not

854
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,440
really a field constraint that we have

855
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,880
to think about

856
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,640
um i mean i think as a general rule you

857
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,279
want to drill as many cores as you can

858
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,720
right um if you've got a good uh if

859
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,799
you've got a good sort of

860
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,200
uh set of measurements right it seems to

861
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,480
be that you know within about

862
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,799
i don't know less less than 10 right

863
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,960
um you seem to be able to get sort of a

864
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,039
reasonable uncertainty on this and

865
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,720
although this number is 20 right that's

866
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,279
the full width of the 95

867
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,000
confidence interval so that's that's not

868
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,919
actually

869
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,760
as large a number as you would think

870
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,080
when you compare it to sort of

871
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,600
what we normally look about with pale

872
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,279
intensity results which is where we we

873
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,159
often will say to the standard deviation

874
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:53,120
of five microteslas is what's acceptable

875
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,080
so you know maybe maybe drill sort of

876
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,320
you know

877
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,120
uh 10 10 would be great right if you can

878
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,919
get

879
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,640
uh six or seven might be more realistic

880
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,399
yeah

881
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,159
yeah okay so when

882
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,440
uh just a quick question i mean

883
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,799
obviously this depends upon the

884
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,120
linearity between your

885
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:18,720
um curvature um

886
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,200
and i just wondered uh you know have you

887
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,080
you know you showed up one graph i guess

888
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,760
that looked legally linear but

889
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,440
to have much confidence in this would be

890
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,080
nice to have some

891
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,440
sort of understanding of about why that

892
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,840
should be or if it

893
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,799
varies according to different mineralogy

894
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,960
or distribution

895
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,320
yeah i i have no idea why um

896
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,760
why that's the case so i didn't i didn't

897
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,200
show the data here but those crosser

898
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,279
data as well they also

899
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,120
obey this kind of they're actually

900
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,320
really highly linear

901
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,640
except for the single domain one but um

902
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
it doesn't it's not that far off the

903
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,880
line so

904
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
it doesn't it doesn't bias the result

905
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,159
that much so i called that site

906
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,720
synthetic 60 because it doesn't have a

907
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,559
name

908
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,240
and you can see that it's it's moved

909
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,840
slightly high but um

910
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,159
it still gives you sort of a reasonable

911
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,279
result um

912
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,320
but those that all the all the um

913
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,640
sort of non perfect sd things

914
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,000
lie on like an almost perfect line when

915
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,000
you use this method on them

916
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,679
so i do think that there's potentially

917
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,520
whatever this effect is there is

918
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,000
potentially some sort of relationship

919
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,760
there which

920
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,440
i you know it's interesting unless

921
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,840
unless that's just a fluke

922
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,919
um but i it does seem to keep coming up

923
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,559
in in sites where you know

924
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,440
you wouldn't expect it to where you know

925
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,760
you see

926
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,840
things that have you know very linear

927
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
looking um results which is which is

928
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,240
always interesting to me

929
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,080
i i have no idea why i did i did try um

930
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,760
because i was like okay well

931
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,760
you know there's no reason that it

932
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,600
should be a linear model i did try doing

933
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,120
this with um

934
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,480
higher order polynomial fits and um just

935
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,840
to see you know if something if

936
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,440
something like that would work or if

937
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
there's different models that would be

938
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,000
appropriate

939
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,240
and they're all worse basically because

940
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,320
the number of parameters increases and

941
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,320
the um

942
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,080
the sort of there's not a multi-demand

943
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,840
effect right because you'd see it in the

944
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,799
ptrm checks to certain degree

945
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,120
what do you mean the curvature

946
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,679
curvature's not a multiple yeah

947
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,080
well the linearity um

948
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,039
well okay so that's the linearity of the

949
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,720
curvature

950
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,640
with the specimen level intensity

951
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,919
i think comes from the fact that i'm

952
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,279
using that tangent

953
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,840
to fit things um i don't think you would

954
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,880
see that

955
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,840
as easily if you were just using

956
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,519
um like you know a best fitting line to

957
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,200
part the data or something like that

958
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,120
i think that's why this this hasn't been

959
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,279
observed so it's it's something to do

960
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,399
with like the aspect ratio of that

961
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,919
i i don't i honestly can't couldn't

962
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,799
comment on why

963
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,440
it's the case um but um i think it's i

964
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,120
think it's

965
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,360
interesting that it it's something that

966
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,880
i've observed um but yeah i did i did

967
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,519
try harder all the polynomial fits and

968
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,200
the the

969
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,799
precision blows up and the accuracy

970
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,159
doesn't get any better so

971
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,840
i thought that the linear fit is the

972
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,519
most appropriate thing to

973
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,559
to apply here yeah okay looks good

974
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,640
so we've got another question from greg

975
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,080
hi hi brendan um that's a really good

976
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,799
talk um

977
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,840
there's a ton of stuff to to for me to

978
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,080
think about and to

979
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,120
digest there but actually this the main

980
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,120
thing i'll

981
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,559
also make a comment on is um kind of

982
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,440
follows on from what you're just talking

983
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,799
about

984
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,440
um you know at first glance you might

985
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,480
think that

986
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,039
this method might depend a little bit on

987
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,919
um your choice of how you define your

988
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,120
tangent

989
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,480
um when you're um fitting your curves

990
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,200
but um i i i suspect that it probably

991
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,279
doesn't

992
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,480
um and this kind of comes back to some

993
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,080
of the data that that

994
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,080
we saw when we looked at the synthetic

995
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,480
samples in the original curvature paper

996
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,159
and i think the reason why you see such

997
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,200
a nice linear relationship between

998
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,399
curvature and

999
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,200
intensity so you know if you pick

1000
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,399
you can actually pick a best fit line on

1001
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
almost any segment

1002
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,159
of um of the curved derived plot and

1003
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,880
you'll find that there is a general

1004
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,399
um linear relationship with that

1005
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,600
intensity estimate

1006
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,880
and the degree of curvature and and

1007
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,360
that's just

1008
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,600
it's a a geometric factor with how

1009
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,679
a circle is fitted the curvature of a

1010
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,880
circle basically is related

1011
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,960
to its its slope um but i'd be

1012
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,039
interested to see if you were to define

1013
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,840
your tangent differently

1014
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,080
um that make sure that you do get a

1015
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,919
consistent linear behavior

1016
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,760
um when you're comparing intensity to um

1017
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,679
to the curvature and all it should

1018
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,480
really do i suspect is change

1019
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,679
the uh slope of that linear relationship

1020
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,200
and that that would be a quite useful

1021
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,399
thing to check that it's robust that

1022
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,640
it's independent of how you define

1023
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,159
your tangent fit and then there's a ton

1024
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,679
of other questions and ideas and things

1025
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,079
but i don't think we'll have time to

1026
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,679
to yeah feel free discussing you know if

1027
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:19,839
you want to talk about it sometimes

1028
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,839
yeah cool thank you very much

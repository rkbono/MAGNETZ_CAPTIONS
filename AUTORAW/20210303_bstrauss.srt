1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,200
welcome hi everybody um welcome to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,559
um the next um in our 2021 series of of

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
the magnet seminars

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,639
uh we've been going strong for quite a

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,719
while and and we had some really great

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,720
uh support from our community so thank

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,760
you everybody uh for coming along and

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,560
thank you to

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,480
um all of our pre presenters uh past

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,960
present and future

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,400
um just a quick reminder for those who

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,920
haven't joined us before

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,880
um the magnet seminars are 25-minute

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,040
30-minute

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,120
presentations so we kindly ask that you

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,000
keep your microphones uh muted

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,840
um and during the the presentation and

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,079
if you have uh problems with your

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,320
internet connection um turning off your

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,800
video can can help improve that

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,039
um after the seminar we'll have um time

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,199
for our 10 to 15 minute

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,079
question session and discussion session

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,559
and questions are are welcomed via the

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
um text chat as well as via the

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,920
microphone um

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
if you don't want to speak um with the

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
microphone please just type into the

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
chat no mic

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,680
and i myself or one of our co-hosts will

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,400
um i read out the question um for you

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
and as always we've got our um our lives

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
going on around us

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,640
in in still in the midst of a global

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
pandemic

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
so if you do have to get up and go uh

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,240
halfway through please

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,439
just um get up and go it's absolutely

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,360
fine

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,360
and at the end of the the seminar we

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,960
have some time uh for a bit of a catch

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,759
up a bit of a social

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
um um time for us to chat with each

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
other and just

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,320
see how everybody is is getting on and

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
this part of the

47
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,000
the seminar series isn't actually

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
recorded so you won't have to

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,079
you can unmute and you can show your

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,119
video

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,240
um so today we have uh beck strauss

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,520
who is from uh not only from nist but

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,399
also from nasa

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,399
um and they will be talking about um

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,360
constraining uh the moon's magnetic

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
field from

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,119
the analysis of apollo samples so beck

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,159
thank you very much for

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
uh speaking today

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
thanks very much for having me let me

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
see if i can share my screen

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
okay we see in my slides all right

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,280
perfect

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
great um thank you again for having me

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
today it's a little bit intimidating to

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
follow lisa tookes but i will do my best

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
again for those who haven't met me

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
before i'm beck strauss my pronouns are

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,000
they them theirs

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,319
and i am a term research scientist at

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
nist currently on detail to nasa goddard

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,280
space flight center

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,360
so today i'm going to talk with you a

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
little bit about how we can use apollo

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,599
samples

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
to study the decline of the moon's

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,400
magnetic field

78
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,680
so measurements from orbiters landers

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
and portable magnetometers at the moon

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,480
have told us

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,319
that the moon does not have a strong

82
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,560
magnetic field in the present day

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,360
and in fact these uh these measurements

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,280
generally agree

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,879
that the surface field intensity there

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,360
is on the order of somewhere less than

87
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,519
one

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
nanotesla which is pretty weak and for

89
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
paleomagnetic purposes

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,040
we can think of the modern moon as

91
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,879
essentially a zero field environment

92
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
now the big exception to this is some

93
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,840
regions of magnetized crust or crustal

94
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
anomalies

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,440
some of which are associated with

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
features like craters and lunar swirls

97
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,640
and we can take these as evidence that

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
the moon must have had a much stronger

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,319
magnetic field

100
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,120
in the past to understand the history of

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
that field

102
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
we've been working with material from

103
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,840
the apollo sample suite which is made up

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,920
of more than 2 000

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
rock regolith and core samples collected

106
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
by the apollo astronauts and returned to

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
earth

108
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,680
these collections are now available

109
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
primarily through johnson space center

110
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
and the captain program

111
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,120
which has recently changed to xmag the

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,440
extraterrestrial materials analysis

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,040
group

114
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
when i think about studies of lunar

115
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,280
paleomagnetism it's uh most helpful to

116
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,959
conceptualize them on a timeline so

117
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
here i've got billions of years before

118
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
the present on our x-axis with the

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,040
present-day all the way to the right

120
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,959
and paleo intensity or the strength of

121
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,640
the ancient field on the y-axis in

122
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,840
microteslas please note that that is a

123
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,319
log scale

124
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
there are two kinds of data on this plot

125
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,280
first the

126
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,720
filled shapes indicate actual records of

127
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,280
ancient magnetic fields

128
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,120
and the open shapes indicate maximum

129
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,199
intensities those fields could have had

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,799
based on the recording limits of the

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,479
associated samples which i'll come back

132
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,720
to in a little bit

133
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,479
so i want to point out some big trends

134
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
in this collection of data to help guide

135
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,360
your eye through how we usually

136
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
interpret it

137
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
there is a generally recognized high

138
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,400
field period when

139
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
the moon's magnetic field reached

140
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,720
surface intensities um

141
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,440
of an average of 77 microteslas

142
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,160
somewhere between 3.56 and 3.5

143
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,000
3.85 billion years ago excuse me

144
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,759
subsequent to the high field period a

145
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
series of studies established that there

146
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,080
was no longer any evidence for fields

147
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,360
stronger than about four microteslas

148
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,280
by around 3.19 billion years ago

149
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
now from that information alone we can

150
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
start constructing this kind of generic

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
schematic curve this is not quantitative

152
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
this is purely intended to guide your

153
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
eye through the data

154
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,880
so a few years ago another study came

155
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
out that found an actual record

156
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
of a roughly five microtesla field in a

157
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,600
much younger sample

158
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,600
dated to somewhere between one and two

159
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
billion years old and a study that was

160
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
published

161
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
last year in 2020 showed that there was

162
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
no evidence for fields any stronger than

163
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,240
about 0.1 microteslas by a half a

164
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
billion years ago

165
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
so that was a lot all at once the main

166
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
thing that we're interested here

167
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,000
interested in here is that the

168
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
paleomagnetic data from apollo samples

169
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,199
seems to indicate

170
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,080
the moon's field didn't just up and turn

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,680
off one day

172
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,680
rather it went through a couple of

173
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
periods of decline

174
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
we're really interested in these dynamic

175
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
changes in

176
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,120
the intensity of the lunar field because

177
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,680
intensities of magnetic fields tell us

178
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,199
something about planetary interiors

179
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,960
a whole bunch of mechanisms at least a

180
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,120
dozen have been proposed to explain

181
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
why the moon had a strong magnetic field

182
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
at some point and what might have

183
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,319
happened to it and i'm just going to

184
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,880
mention a few of the major ones here

185
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,280
some studies have looked into chemical

186
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,319
convection dynamos or impact generated

187
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
dynamo systems

188
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
which would have been able to account

189
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
for fields on the order of maybe seven

190
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,639
to ten microteslas but wouldn't have

191
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,680
lasted much past

192
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,759
3.8 billion years ago other studies have

193
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,600
looked into precession dynamos where the

194
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
interior and exterior portions of the

195
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
moon could have been decoupled and moved

196
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,919
relative to each

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
other and that motion and the associated

198
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,639
stirring might have been enough to

199
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
generate the currents we need for

200
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,360
magnetic fields

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
that could have given us field strengths

202
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
on the order of 100 micro teslas and

203
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,919
would have lasted till

204
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
maybe 2 billion years ago depending

205
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,120
whose model you like for how far

206
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,639
the moon was from the earth at any given

207
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,880
point in time

208
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,639
and still other studies have looked at

209
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,240
thermochemical convection similar to

210
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,600
what we have on the earth today

211
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,360
this would have been able to sustain

212
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,440
fields on the order of five or six micro

213
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
teslas till maybe a billion years ago

214
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,800
tops

215
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
so you may be looking at this end

216
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
rightly saying to yourself there is not

217
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
very much data on this plot

218
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,800
what that means is we really need to

219
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,560
keep an eye on small number statistics

220
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
problems and make sure we're not

221
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,560
creating these big assertions out of a

222
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
statistical anomaly

223
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
so i want to answer a couple of

224
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,840
questions in this study the first is

225
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,160
did the lunar dynamo really decline

226
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,400
after 3.56 billion years ago

227
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
or are we suffering from a small amount

228
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,319
of data could there be methodological

229
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
problems or issues with our materials

230
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,759
and second if the dynamo did decline

231
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,520
what happened to it

232
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,880
what kind of change in mechanism could

233
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,520
explain this

234
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
this change in state that we observe to

235
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,599
answer these

236
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,280
questions we need to work with samples

237
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,400
that are capable of recording weak

238
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,759
magnetic fields

239
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,639
after 3.2 billion years ago so that

240
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
brings us to

241
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
a case study using some apollo 12

242
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,440
basalts this is

243
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,960
primarily work that i did with sonya

244
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
tiku while we were both at rutgers

245
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,199
university

246
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,560
and we just had it published in the

247
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
journal of geophysical research planets

248
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,319
so we'll start with a field map for the

249
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,160
field geologists in the room uh this is

250
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
the location where our samples were

251
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
collected at the apollo 12 landing site

252
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
please pardon the truck noise in the

253
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,800
background

254
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
um all three samples were collected from

255
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,199
the sort of upper left edge of this

256
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
image and i have photos from a couple of

257
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,599
the locations where our samples were

258
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
picked up

259
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,120
unfortunately i don't have a photo for

260
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,639
where the third sample was collected and

261
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
this i think is a point in favor of

262
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
sending more geologists to the moon

263
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,680
because we know to take a picture before

264
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
we mess with the field site

265
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
so these are the actual samples that we

266
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,639
worked with we got much smaller pieces

267
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
of course these are each about the size

268
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,000
of the palm of your hand these are

269
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,760
apollo 12 samples 12008-12009

270
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,440
and 12015 and just for fun uh after all

271
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
of the analyses i did take a couple of

272
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,640
photos of me holding the samples

273
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,959
you may notice that each of our little

274
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,719
sub-sample slices has an orienting arrow

275
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,880
on the disk to which it's attached and

276
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,959
this is because we wanted to preserve

277
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,480
the relative orientation of subsamples

278
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,000
from each of our main samples

279
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,040
even though the bulk samples themselves

280
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,440
were not oriented on collection

281
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,760
okay so all three of these rocks are

282
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,600
olivine vitrifier mari basalts

283
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,440
and our microscopy didn't turn up any

284
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
evidence of major shock effects so

285
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
we are going to assert that these were

286
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
most likely magnetized through a trm a

287
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
thermo-remnant magnetization

288
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,120
we determined new argon argon ages for

289
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,440
two of these samples and

290
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
the first ever argon argon ages for the

291
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,160
third and

292
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,600
dated all three of them to about 3.1

293
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,200
billion years ago which is exactly what

294
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
we had been hoping for

295
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,959
now because these samples were rapidly

296
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
cooled and have a fine overall grain

297
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,120
size

298
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
our hope was that they might contain

299
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,640
some fine-grained magnetic material that

300
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
would make them good paleomagnetic

301
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
recorders

302
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,600
and at this scale we were able to

303
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,040
observe some bright metallic grains that

304
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
we thought might be the iron nickel

305
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,320
grains suggested by previous studies to

306
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,320
exist in these samples

307
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,040
okay i'm going to go right into our

308
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,959
paleomagnetic results first

309
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,560
the first question we asked was did

310
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,440
these samples record a field when they

311
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,519
formed

312
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,640
now usually when i give this talk i'm

313
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,080
talking to people who have never

314
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,519
taught uh never thought about magnets

315
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,440
before so i go through a little

316
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,640
explanation of how we build xiphel

317
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,240
diagrams and what they're kind of

318
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,079
supposed to look like and how the data

319
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,680
should trend toward the origin

320
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,519
but i think in this group i can probably

321
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,360
just show you my data

322
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
uh if you are familiar with ciderfeld

323
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,240
plots at all you may be noticing that

324
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
these are statistically

325
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,519
indistinguishable from spaghetti

326
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,360
at least once we remove this low

327
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,800
coercivity component that's consistent

328
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
with an overprint from just hanging out

329
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,519
in the earth's magnetic field for about

330
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,760
50 years

331
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
so unfortunately we're looking at the

332
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
data that's indistinguishable from noise

333
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
and what that means

334
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,200
is we were not able to retrieve a stable

335
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,800
high coercivity magnetization

336
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,200
through a standard afd mag of the nrm

337
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
so then we asked how weak a field could

338
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,959
these samples have recorded

339
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,480
if there was a field present at the time

340
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,839
now this is an important question to ask

341
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
in lunar studies because the

342
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,040
paleomagnetic techniques that were used

343
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,720
during the apollo era

344
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,800
were not always able to differentiate

345
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,240
between samples that did not record an

346
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
ancient magnetic field

347
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,560
and samples that just had poor remnants

348
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,720
or shoddy recording properties

349
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,160
or between samples that did record

350
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
strong planetary fields

351
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,320
and those that had just picked up

352
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
spurious remnants on earth

353
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,920
so to determine the fidelity limits for

354
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
these three samples we performed a

355
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,200
series of laboratory experiments in

356
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
which we were essentially applying a

357
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
magnetic field of a known intensity to

358
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,000
each sample

359
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,519
to simulate a trm at room temperature

360
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
because nasa doesn't love it when you

361
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,480
cook their rocks

362
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,839
um and then attempted to get back a

363
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
record of that applied field

364
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,760
using the same af dmag methods that we

365
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,399
had to try to get at nrm in the first

366
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
place

367
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,760
the hope being that we should see a

368
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,959
one-to-one relationship between the

369
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,959
applied field and the retrieved field

370
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,240
here are the results of those analyses

371
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,040
if you look at the plot all the way to

372
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
the left

373
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,480
we have our applied laboratory field on

374
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
the x-axis

375
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,640
in microteslas and the retrieved paleo

376
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
intensity on the y-axis again in

377
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
microteslas

378
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,440
and ideally all of our data should

379
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,839
cluster around this one-to-one

380
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,200
line that i've got in gray dash here

381
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,880
it's kind of hard to see exactly what's

382
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
happening from that figure alone so if

383
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
you look instead

384
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
at the middle figure we're applauding

385
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
we're re-plotting exactly the same data

386
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,000
in

387
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,279
a different way now we have the applied

388
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,880
field on the x-axis

389
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,880
and the difference between the applied

390
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,360
field and the retrieve field on the y

391
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,800
and using this 100 difference cut-offs

392
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
from some previous studies

393
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,320
we found that two of our samples could

394
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,079
give us back good records of fields as

395
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
weak as seven microteslas

396
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,360
and one of our samples was able to give

397
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
us back good records of fields as weak

398
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
as

399
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,800
four micro teslas which is pretty good

400
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,120
so

401
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,040
we would say that our af methods would

402
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,320
have been capable of retrieving records

403
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,920
of a weak trm

404
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
if the magnetizing fields were any

405
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
stronger than about four to seven

406
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,399
microtesles

407
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,639
you may recall from two slides ago that

408
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,079
we did no such thing

409
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
so let's go back to our timeline for a

410
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
second we have some new argon

411
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
argon dates we have some new fidelity

412
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
limits and we can add our three points

413
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
onto this timeline effectively

414
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,880
quadrupling the amount of data available

415
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,440
between 3.1 and 3.2 billion years ago

416
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
which is sort of fun to say one of the

417
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
things that i

418
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
really enjoyed about this study is that

419
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,279
we got results that are in really nice

420
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,279
agreement with previous work and this is

421
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,959
essentially a replication study

422
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,240
a hill that i will eventually die on is

423
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
that we should be able to do more

424
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,920
studies like that

425
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,360
because what this lets us do is we can

426
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,959
think back to this small number

427
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,079
statistics issue i brought up at the

428
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,399
front of the talk

429
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,880
and ask is the decline that we're seeing

430
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,200
actually statistically significant

431
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,680
we wanted to determine whether the paleo

432
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,000
intensities in the high field period

433
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
and the intensity limits determined in

434
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,680
this period of

435
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
initial field decline are really derived

436
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,560
from

437
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,839
separate populations or separate events

438
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,600
or whether they could be coming from the

439
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,959
same initial distribution of paleo

440
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,720
intensity values

441
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,600
so prior to the study just looking at

442
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,040
literature a ks test gave us a p-value

443
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,880
of 0.0152

444
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,480
saying these are almost certainly not

445
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,519
from excuse me these are almost

446
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,120
certainly not

447
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,440
random or from the same initial

448
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,360
distribution but when we add our three

449
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
data points we're unable to improve that

450
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
result by an order of magnitude and say

451
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,240
with

452
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,839
much more confidence that there was

453
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
about an order of magnitude field

454
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,560
decline

455
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
subsequent to the high field period on

456
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,880
the moon

457
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,079
so now we can extend our generic

458
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,760
schematic line

459
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,839
uh and say with a little bit more

460
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
confidence too that following the high

461
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,560
field period

462
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
there was a state change that put us

463
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,079
into a sustained weak field period

464
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,920
for some additional period of time so

465
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
again the reason that we're interested

466
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,560
in these kinds of questions about

467
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,160
changing intensity

468
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,839
is that they tell us something about the

469
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
mechanisms by which the field was

470
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,880
generated

471
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,800
and the hope is that by improving our

472
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,880
constraint of the timeline

473
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
we can eliminate some of these candidate

474
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
mechanisms from

475
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,760
our plot i'm not going to talk about

476
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
that right now though what i do want to

477
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
talk about instead

478
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,560
is the question of what is recording

479
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,240
these fields so i really want to talk

480
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,320
about mineralogy today because

481
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,320
these three samples have particularly

482
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,040
excellent fidelity properties for lunar

483
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,880
rocks

484
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,320
and i got pretty excited about trying to

485
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,399
figure out why so

486
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,440
previous studies have showed that the

487
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,760
ferromagnetic

488
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,600
mineralogy of lunar rocks is primarily

489
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,920
metallic iron and camasite

490
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,760
which is a low nickel iron nickel alloy

491
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,560
and i wanted to explore a little and see

492
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,160
what we could do with that information

493
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
so at rutgers we had access to an

494
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,880
electron microprobe uh

495
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,720
what you're looking at here in the

496
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,880
second through fourth columns are

497
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
qualitative elemental x-ray maps which

498
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,760
we collected in addition to obtaining

499
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,760
quantitative points from

500
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,920
individual grains you can basically

501
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,920
think of each pixel in each image as

502
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
representing a single data point

503
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,399
so if you look at the third column which

504
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,560
has this kind of navy blue background

505
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,720
we're showing iron in blue and nickel in

506
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,480
green and from that we can say we were

507
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639
definitely seeing some actual iron

508
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
nickel grains which was pretty cool

509
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,600
i do want to highlight a few things that

510
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,639
we noticed during these observations

511
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
though

512
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,079
first we found grains with different

513
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,320
iron nickel ratios within

514
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
each sample and we were able to identify

515
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
both camasite

516
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,199
and martensite in this total collection

517
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
of grains in fact we were mostly finding

518
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
martensite which is a

519
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,320
slightly higher nickel content than

520
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,480
campasite we also saw

521
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,920
that many of these iron nickel grains

522
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
are not homogeneous

523
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,839
so in this figure you can see some

524
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,759
compositional gradients across a few

525
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,959
but not all of the grains that i'm

526
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
showing

527
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
there are color differences across the

528
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,480
grains and we

529
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,480
also observed some very likely iron

530
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,320
nickel grains of a sub micron size that

531
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
were unfortunately too small to acquire

532
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,079
quantitative points from

533
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
individually so in summary we were able

534
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,399
to observe what we're pretty sure our

535
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,759
multiple grain sizes of both camisite

536
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,680
and martensite

537
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,880
again pretty cool we've also been

538
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
thinking about some

539
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,759
studies that were published recently

540
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,199
suggesting that association with

541
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
troilite which is an iron sulfide

542
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
mineral

543
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,519
might be an indicator of good

544
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
paleomagnetic fidelity in lunar basalts

545
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
but we went looking and that's what's

546
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,639
going on with this fourth column where

547
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
now we've got sulfur in magenta

548
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,040
and iron in blue and we didn't find any

549
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,000
grains with compositions consistent with

550
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,560
trolite

551
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,079
so in general we would say that troilite

552
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,160
may be forming through

553
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,320
processes that also produce submicron

554
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,079
iron grains in some lunar rocks

555
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,680
but it's clearly not a requirement in

556
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,480
order for lunar rocks to have good

557
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,000
paleo-intensity fidelity

558
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
so then we also did some hysteresis

559
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,839
experiments the figures here are each

560
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,760
showing a representative subsample of

561
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,919
one of our three main samples

562
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,679
and we've got our applied field strength

563
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
in teslas on the x-axis

564
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,120
and the measured moment in ammeter

565
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,520
squared on the y-axis the

566
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
orange curves are raw data and the blue

567
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,240
curves are corrected for parametric

568
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,880
slope you might

569
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,919
recognize the irmdb software output here

570
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,679
i've also pulled out some of the

571
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,199
parameters that we used to define the

572
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,480
shape and size of each of our loops and

573
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,880
i will come back to that

574
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
very shortly so our measurements were

575
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,559
dominated by diamagnetic and

576
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,320
paramagnetic contributions probably

577
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,320
because we were using very small samples

578
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,240
for these particular experiments

579
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760
but we did also observe some open loops

580
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,039
that we thought could be suggestive of

581
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
multi-domain states

582
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,480
and i want to note that they could also

583
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,320
be explained by some combination of

584
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,320
having extremely weak samples

585
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,320
and some known thermal disequilibrium

586
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,720
issues with the particular agfm that we

587
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,200
were using

588
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
okay so let's step back for a second and

589
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
talk about

590
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,360
domain behavior in lunar rocks between

591
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,120
beyond these three samples

592
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,640
what i'm showing here is a day plot and

593
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
these are typically used to understand

594
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,000
the hysteresis parameters of different

595
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,919
samples relative to each other

596
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
now i know that the terrestrial folks in

597
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,039
the room may be a little bit alarmed to

598
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
see this here especially if you are

599
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,880
familiar with andy roberts's seminal

600
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,840
2018 paper a critical appraisal of the

601
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,120
day diagram

602
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,400
but i ask you to please bear with me

603
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
because there is a point that i'm going

604
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
to try to make with this

605
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,280
um so on our x-axis we have remnant

606
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,440
coercivity

607
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,520
divided by coercive force and on our

608
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,440
y-axis we've got saturation remnant

609
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
magnetization divided by saturation

610
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,400
magnetization

611
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,640
and the general hope with the day plot

612
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
like this is that samples with better

613
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,320
recording properties

614
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,240
should plot toward the upper left and

615
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
may correspond with better magnetic

616
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,880
fidelity

617
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,480
so what we built in our study is to our

618
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
knowledge the largest published

619
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
compilation of hysteresis parameters

620
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,679
from apollo samples to date

621
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,679
each data point that you're seeing here

622
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,559
represents one sample or sub sample from

623
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
literature

624
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,640
sorted by bulk rock type kind of as a

625
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,320
first pass and the data from our study

626
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
is in the orange squares

627
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,480
i've also included these gray dashed

628
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,240
lines to indicate domain state regions

629
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,160
from the original day plot

630
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,000
so note the positions of samples from a

631
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,120
few recent studies on this figure just

632
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
by way of example

633
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,080
and you can kind of get a sense from

634
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
this handful of points that the general

635
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,919
trend we're hoping for

636
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,840
does seem to hold we see better lower

637
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,559
fidelity limits as we look toward the

638
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,200
upper left

639
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,480
of the plot however there is a problem

640
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,760
okay there's like there's a bunch of

641
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
problems with this figure but i'm just

642
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,840
gonna focus on one today

643
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,039
um those dashed lines do not actually

644
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,960
exist

645
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,720
the guiding domain parameter ranges were

646
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,320
originally developed for magnetite and

647
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,520
are not applicable to other kinds of

648
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
magnetic minerals

649
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,520
and this is crucial because not a single

650
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,919
one of the samples shown on this plot

651
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
nor

652
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,200
any of the samples used to build that

653
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,320
paleo intensity timeline

654
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,679
contain magnetite all that being said

655
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,200
we built this plot in the first place

656
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,720
because i wanted to understand our

657
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
samples in context

658
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,240
about half of the data that you see here

659
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,120
was collected prior to the invention of

660
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,960
forks when

661
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,640
this technique really was the cutting

662
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
edge and i'm convinced that we can at

663
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,760
least start some useful discussions

664
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,679
about how to go forward by

665
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,440
making these kinds of comparisons so

666
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,280
long story short i'm very proud of the

667
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,039
data compilation that we assembled here

668
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
and it is freely available at the nist

669
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,679
data repository with the link at the

670
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
bottom of the slide

671
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,320
um but i do strongly caution against

672
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,000
using day plots to determine specific

673
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,679
domain states or grain sizes

674
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,679
for the magnetic minerals in lunar

675
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,520
samples

676
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,880
okay if you zoned out or went to check

677
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,960
your phone i'm now going to summarize my

678
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,880
whole talk in about a minute and a half

679
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
what happened to the lunar field after

680
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,960
3.56 billion

681
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,240
years ago our methods would have been

682
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,080
able to retrieve a record

683
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,600
if the magnetizing field was any

684
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,919
stronger than about four to seven

685
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,880
microteslas however we did not retrieve

686
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,559
a stable record

687
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
of a magnetization consistent with that

688
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,799
kind of planetary field therefore

689
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,159
we find no evidence for lunar surface

690
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,039
fields any stronger than seven

691
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,440
microteslas

692
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,280
at about 3.1 billion years ago and as a

693
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,520
reminder this is roughly an order of

694
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,960
magnitude decline in field intensity

695
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
over about 370 million years in order to

696
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,080
explain this

697
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,360
we need either multiple mechanisms of

698
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,679
field generation or

699
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,679
a bistable dynamo for which the idea

700
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
would be some dynamo system that could

701
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,840
sustain itself in a strong state get

702
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
destabilized and then be reasserted in a

703
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,480
weak state

704
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,760
we think it's a little bit more likely

705
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,760
that we're looking at multiple

706
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,400
mechanisms here and we're particularly

707
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,039
interested

708
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,159
in a precession generated dynamo which

709
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,159
could have given way to

710
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,679
an underlying thermochemical convection

711
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,360
system after the moon

712
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,120
reached such a distance from the earth

713
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,360
that its gravitational state

714
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,280
uh destabilized the procession required

715
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,039
to produce those strong's field those

716
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,200
strong fields

717
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,320
and with that i will leave up a few of

718
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,919
our major takeaways

719
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,520
i want to say thank you again for having

720
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,520
me today it's a real honor to be part of

721
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,320
the magnet series i want to thank the

722
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,960
captain

723
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,679
program for sample allocation um and

724
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
thank you to

725
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,960
the two folks i think maybe in the

726
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,320
audience today who reviewed our paper

727
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
and gave some really genuinely

728
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,640
constructive feedback that actually

729
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,080
uh really helped with the draft that we

730
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,880
were putting together

731
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,720
i also want to make a very quick plug uh

732
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,320
if you are going to lpsc the lunar and

733
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
planetary science conference in a couple

734
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
of weeks

735
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,679
i'm giving two presentations one is on

736
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,360
uh magnetic domain domain behavior and

737
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,480
interpretation in apollo samples where

738
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,559
i'm going to go a little bit more in

739
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,400
depth on lunar magnetic mineralogy

740
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,840
and i'm also presenting a poster on some

741
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
work that i've been leading on gender

742
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,200
inclusive study methods in planetary

743
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,960
science and related fields and how we

744
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
can be more welcome to

745
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,799
welcoming to trans and non-binary people

746
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
in our study areas

747
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,039
and with that i'd be happy to take

748
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,039
questions

749
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
thank you very much beck i was great

750
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,600
presentation

751
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,640
uh really really really good um we are

752
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,159
ready now to take

753
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:54,080
questions if anybody yeah big round of

754
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:56,720
applause thank you

755
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,480
if you if you don't want to speak you

756
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,919
can drop your question in the chat

757
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:06,640
as well carney

758
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,640
says awesome talk thank you back thank

759
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
you

760
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,720
sorry i'll get the ball rolling um on

761
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,799
some questions

762
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,600
so you you're talking about um

763
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,159
a sort of order of magnitude drop um

764
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,480
over

765
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,360
over sorry what what length of time uh

766
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,280
was it

767
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,640
370 million years or so yeah i mean

768
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,039
have you thought about how that compares

769
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,480
to some of the the changes that we see

770
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,159
in terrestrial uh patio intensity data

771
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,679
yeah so this is uh this is something

772
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,279
that actually our reviewers gave us very

773
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,039
good feedback on uh we've gotten into

774
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,919
the habit of describing these

775
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,080
periods of decline as rapid because the

776
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,000
temporal resolution of data that we have

777
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,480
for the moon's magnetic field is so

778
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,520
sparse so when something happens one

779
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,279
billion years ago

780
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,960
and something else happens three billion

781
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,159
years ago everything in the middle feels

782
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
really fast when you have nothing to

783
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,760
compare to

784
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,320
but compared to terrestrial systems this

785
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,799
370 million year decline is probably

786
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,679
quite

787
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,600
slow and in order to get a little bit

788
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,360
more nuance about that honestly this is

789
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,559
one of the biggest pitches for

790
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,480
both improving our access to doing

791
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,240
magnetic studies of the apollo sample

792
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,000
suite because we have all this

793
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,360
this material available we might be able

794
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
to get better resolution

795
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,720
but also a pitch for thinking about how

796
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,559
we do

797
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,320
sample return in the future and with

798
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,039
lunar missions like artemis and even

799
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,440
mars missions we can think about how to

800
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,640
um improve coverage that might let us

801
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,799
get at things like

802
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,240
for instance reversals i have no idea if

803
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,600
there were reversals on the moon because

804
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,840
we just don't have the

805
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,840
the data to show that yet

806
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,120
thank you james is his hand

807
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,400
up i think that was a really nice talk

808
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,640
thank you for giving that thank you

809
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,159
um you mentioned that most of the grains

810
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,400
in your samples uh

811
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,360
martensite um and i just want to kind of

812
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,559
ask uh

813
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
what you thought the actual going

814
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,039
through the martensitic transition would

815
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
have done to a pain intensity would have

816
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,000
been like a

817
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,159
a re-recording will it be a crm would be

818
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,520
a trm would it be a crm that's carrying

819
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,360
a trm like what actually

820
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,720
sort of um mechanically is happening

821
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
there and what do you think the impacts

822
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,520
of that would be on a paleontology you

823
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,919
recover from a sample like this so

824
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,960
our our current understanding of this

825
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
and i do

826
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,480
want to like go on a tangent about how

827
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,159
we need to understand martensite more

828
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,840
thoroughly in this context

829
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,360
separately um but our current

830
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,559
understanding of this is that

831
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,600
the the um transition into martensite

832
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,480
was likely happening

833
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,120
very rapidly looking at the grain sizes

834
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,880
that we see

835
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,120
and the textures that are visible in our

836
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,760
microscopy we think that these

837
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,600
rocks overall cooled like less than a

838
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,000
day something on that order and from

839
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,360
that we are continuing to refer to this

840
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,279
as a trm

841
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,799
um there we've done a little bit of

842
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,559
digging into literature and it seems

843
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,240
that the overall magnetic behavior of

844
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,840
camasite and martensite are likely very

845
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,520
similar so i think the assumptions that

846
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,039
we've made in order to do these arm to

847
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,440
trm calculations

848
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,039
probably continue to hold for martensite

849
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,039
just because of that speed

850
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,200
um but i would very much like to do a

851
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,919
deep dive into exactly what the nuances

852
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
of these

853
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,279
like honestly these are ranges of

854
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,679
compositions right we say martensite for

855
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,360
things going from five percent up to 25

856
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,400
nickel and then i talked to my material

857
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,760
science colleagues and they're like

858
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,480
that's like eight different things you

859
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,720
know

860
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,320
um so i if you have more thoughts on

861
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,960
this i would very much like to to chat

862
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,960
about that further

863
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,480
thank you thank you now kathy constable

864
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,600
you have your hand

865
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,159
up yeah i was just wondering

866
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
um what the prospects really are for

867
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,000
filling in

868
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,200
based on the apollo samples so

869
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,720
i i i assume that many of them have been

870
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,880
dated and i'm

871
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,000
guessing you've looked at that array of

872
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,120
dates and

873
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,360
thought a little bit about the

874
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,120
composition how many samples do you

875
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,159
think you could get from there or do you

876
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,600
really think you're going to have to go

877
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,320
back

878
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,480
so it's it's really a goldilocks game

879
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,640
right like you need a sample that both

880
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,640
has been dated and is from the correct

881
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,240
time period and has formed in such a way

882
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,440
that it likely could be holding a good

883
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,440
record based on

884
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,640
mineralogy and speed and other processes

885
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
that's been through and handling and

886
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,720
whatnot

887
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,399
um and at the end of that i actually

888
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,840
have a proposal in related to this where

889
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,799
i think we might be able to get on the

890
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,559
order of

891
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,080
like a hundred samples would be cool

892
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,200
maybe a couple hundred would have the

893
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,200
information that we need

894
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,039
currently without doing any further

895
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,919
dating analyses or any further moon

896
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,840
missions

897
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,360
um but if we want to do better than a

898
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,399
hundred or a couple of hundred data

899
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,480
points which is what we

900
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,760
would expect for like a comparable

901
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,360
terrestrial study

902
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,200
then that's where we really have to have

903
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,000
conversations about changing the way we

904
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,559
think about sample

905
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,240
return and there is of course also the

906
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,559
additional layer here where

907
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,000
the processes by which new rocks are

908
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,159
being formed on the moon

909
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,440
are very much relegated to particular

910
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,440
time periods it's not

911
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,679
like we have continuous lava flows

912
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,720
occurring all along that entire timeline

913
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,240
um so the the cross section of

914
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,240
information that we have is i don't

915
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,120
think all 2000 samples would give me

916
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,120
good information

917
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,600
but we could definitely improve what i'm

918
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,559
currently showing by

919
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,120
doubling or tripling the information and

920
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,080
that would

921
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,200
still of course be a somewhat uh i don't

922
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,039
really have an idea of

923
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,840
what how that spotty record would look

924
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,520
yeah it would still be it would still be

925
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,799
terrestrial standards um

926
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,440
but this is like one of the one of what

927
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,279
i think of

928
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,880
are both the funnest parts and the

929
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,600
hardest parts of doing planetary

930
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,679
magnetism

931
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,840
so if we use terrestrial studies as the

932
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,520
standard what i'm showing today is like

933
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,760
almost nothing i've said a huge amount

934
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,240
from three data points but if we look at

935
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,799
mars for instance we're doing way better

936
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
than we

937
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,159
have done for the intensity timeline for

938
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,840
mars so it's really a

939
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,840
it's kind of a relativistic game but i

940
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,120
think a lot better

941
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,559
i mean i think if you look at three

942
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,919
billion years ago on the earth we're not

943
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,600
doing that well either

944
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,600
that's fair that's a fair point

945
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,840
thank you anybody else has questions

946
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,360
elliot remember that you have an answer

947
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,600
for the pressing question of the day

948
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,640
regarding beck's background image if you

949
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,880
want it

950
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,559
oh yes um just context for anyone who

951
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
tuned in a second late i am standing in

952
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,520
front of an image from lady gaga's

953
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,000
chromatica album

954
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,600
and no one has yet been able to identify

955
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,279
the original land feature that this was

956
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,880
photoshopped on top of

957
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,880
so uh elliot what do you think it is

958
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,840
in california

959
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,600
i didn't work it out i did a bit of

960
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,600
google foo

961
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,960
still counts that's literature research

962
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,200
i'll count that yes

963
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,520
but look i have confirmation so yes it's

964
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,720
trolling pinnacles in california

965
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,039
awesome thank you i demand a cookie in

966
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,039
prize

967
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,600
you'll get it thank you

968
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,520
awesome talker so thank you very much

969
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,840
that was deeply enjoyable

970
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,840
thank you

971
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,720
any more questions

972
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,480
andre you have your hand up yeah

973
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,360
well i got intrigued with your uh

974
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,520
uh high series properties compilation

975
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,640
thank you for that

976
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,159
and uh but still uh

977
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:40,080
i would advocate a little bit the old

978
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,080
version of uh of ideas of

979
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,000
we all had about their plot with all the

980
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,039
reservations that eddie did

981
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,039
two years ago three years ago st

982
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:54,559
still if you have

983
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,440
if you have generally very low mrsms

984
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,760
ratios and very high

985
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:04,240
hcrhc ratios

986
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:08,080
does it is it not showing you that

987
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,000
you have you have a lot of very fine

988
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,279
super paramagnetic grains in your

989
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,919
samples

990
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,880
and have you looked at this using maybe

991
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,159
low temperature measurements

992
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,000
so i haven't looked into that

993
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,360
specifically with these samples the the

994
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,600
big day plot that i'm showing

995
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,880
is really compiled from literature and

996
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,200
we haven't been able to do further

997
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,519
experiments due to

998
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,200
because the question about sp is super

999
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,760
paramagnetic grains is that

1000
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,279
unfortunately if you have a lots of them

1001
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,240
in your sample

1002
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,240
they are bound to be a very bad

1003
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,360
recording of any magnetic information

1004
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,600
you would agree so maybe it

1005
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:52,799
might be might be a

1006
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,080
thing to look

1007
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,799
look into because i can't remember many

1008
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,200
low temperature measurements on the

1009
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,519
lunar samples in particular

1010
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,640
yeah it's i i'm racking my brain as

1011
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,480
you're saying that and i think that's

1012
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,720
one of the cases of like

1013
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,080
something that i want to put together

1014
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,760
following this work

1015
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,440
is recommendations for how we can do

1016
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,960
better in the future and so one of the

1017
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,880
things that i've been really focusing on

1018
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,480
is forks because that's now a tool

1019
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,559
that's kind of becoming bread and butter

1020
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,080
and terrestrial paleo

1021
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,840
you have you haven't shown one

1022
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,120
because i don't have any for my own

1023
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,640
samples and i

1024
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,159
was only able to find like one or two

1025
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,799
studies that have collected okay

1026
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,360
okay so so it's it's a matter of future

1027
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,600
yeah

1028
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,640
okay thank you very much very very good

1029
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,399
talk here

1030
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,840
yeah thank you and i do want to say that

1031
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,559
the kind of low temperature experiments

1032
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,159
you recommend

1033
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,240
you're suggesting are exactly the kind

1034
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,000
of thing i think we can start to write

1035
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,360
well it's it's pretty simple it's

1036
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,600
fast fast enough and as far as

1037
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,279
as far as i read about the new

1038
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,159
developments

1039
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:03,519
in minnesota at the irm they've got this

1040
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,159
nice machine in pms3 which is much

1041
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,360
faster than the previous one and

1042
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,080
much nicer and you can collect let's say

1043
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,240
20

1044
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,760
20 times more data through the same time

1045
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,159
so just keep going

1046
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,799
yeah thank you very much for sure thank

1047
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,519
you thank you

1048
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,159
thank you laurie you have your hand hope

1049
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,519
you want to

1050
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,000
ask a question you might want to unmute

1051
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,000
yourself

1052
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,000
thank you great talk back really

1053
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,440
interesting i have a question that's a

1054
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
little off from what you were talking

1055
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,399
about but you did mention the crustal

1056
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,399
anomalies

1057
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,080
and can you say anything about what you

1058
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,679
think the source of those are

1059
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,200
internal or external or whatever

1060
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,360
um i i can vaguely say that i'm on the

1061
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,840
side of buried source bodies of some

1062
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,480
kind

1063
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,000
but i haven't the more i learn about

1064
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,120
lunar swirls the more i learned that i

1065
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,720
don't know anything about lunar

1066
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,799
squirrels so i will unfortunately have

1067
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,120
to punt that question to a colleague who

1068
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,480
has been focusing more on those features

1069
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,480
okay thanks thanks

1070
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,159
thank you so any other questions

1071
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,919
no i guess

1072
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,359
yes if we have uh no more questions

1073
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,679
we'll we'll wrap up

1074
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,359
on this week's magnets so i just want to

1075
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,760
thank beck again for another

1076
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,480
uh fantastic and really uh interesting

1077
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,800
talk

1078
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,919
um it's a great diversity that we're

1079
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,839
building up now

1080
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,679
in in the kind of things that we cover

1081
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,119
in these series so it's it's really

1082
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,679
uh really great to have that thank you

1083
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,639
very much thank you for having me

um so just a a quick reminder of our

1085
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,720
upcoming

1086
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,359
uh schedule um in a couple of weeks we

1087
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,320
will have

1088
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,119
uh andre and we'll be giving us a talk

1089
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
um

1090
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,960
and a couple of weeks after that we have

1091
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,920
an open slot so if anybody is

1092
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,520
interested in presenting their work here

1093
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,920
at magnets please just

1094
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,800
get in touch and then we'll have andrea

1095
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,599

um into april and as before we'll have a

1097
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,400
break for egu

1098
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,520
and then after egu we'll move to um a

1099
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,079
time slot it's a little bit more

1100
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,160
favorable

1101
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,119
for uh our colleagues in the eastern

1102
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
hemisphere uh

1103
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,280
in australia new zealand uh china and

1104
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,640
japan and we'll have more information

1105
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,440
about that coming

1106
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,240
uh coming soon um but as always we're

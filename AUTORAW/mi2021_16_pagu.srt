1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
um yeah so for something completely

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,440
different now

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,600
um hello my name is anna and i am a

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,320
pediatrician at the university of oxford

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,000
and um i am going to present some work

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,679
on tetrathenai specifically its

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,119
identification with various

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,240
um microscopy and magnetic methods um

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,320
this is not a complete study so um if

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
anyone has any feedback on where to go

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,439
next what method supply will um

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,840
how to improve existing methods i'll be

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,520
very helpful

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,640
just going to find the pointer oh yeah

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,399
um tetrodinai is a

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
mineral which has received a lot of

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,520
interest from the magnetic from the

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
meteorite

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
magnesium community in particular

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
meteorites have been used for

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,879
monthly studies because they contain um

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
abundant metal and usually

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,600
um usually oxides and really interesting

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,360
microstructures so they're very

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
interesting

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,039
targets for magnetic studies in

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
particular they've been used for

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,239
the identification of ancient magnetic

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
fields

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,040
and the reason for that is that we can

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,040
use

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,119
magnetic studies to get insight into

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,960
the structure of terrestrial bodies like

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,159
ancient virtual bodies we can get a lot

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
of information like

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
the timing of their creation whether

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,240
they differentiated whether they

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,439
um formed them in a core um the

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,880
that whether they formulate in the core

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
and how they form their size of parent

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
body

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
um and a lot of basically really

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
fascinating information about the early

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
solar system with

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,360
implications to um service evolution and

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,439
early monthly fields and

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,399
earth's magnetic field through

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,920
comparisons

49
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,759
and that's all great but there is of

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
course about um

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,360
meteorites have incredibly complex

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,240
history sometimes they combine

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,960
um impacts that of what they combine

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,439
impacts

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,320
acres alteration metamorphism and so

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,920
what we need

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,320
in order to get all of this really cool

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,439
information is um

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,320
very um

60
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,640
very reliable magnets one such magnet

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
has been identified as the japanite um

62
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,879
so this

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,879
is the ordered um

64
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,920
ordered form of fahrenheit which is

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,480
ionical

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,319
um with high nickel so detroit is

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
generally between 50 and 55 percent

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,200
nicole

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,720
and it forms through very slow cooling

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,599
through the ordering temperature of

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
tetrathena

72
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,720
so um 310 degrees

73
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,319
um importantly it's been identified to

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
have incredibly high co-activity so

75
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,720
after two

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,920
tesla and all of these meteorites are

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,239
ones where tetrotini has been identified

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,920
as

79
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
a reliable carrier

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
now one meteorite that one meteorite

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,319
group which is known to contain abundant

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,440
tetradi which is not on this list is

83
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,800
um the mesosiderides so mesothelioids

84
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
are stained iron meteorites with

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
approximately

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,599
equal parts metal and silica they're

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
generally considered to be mixtures of

88
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,040
core material and crystal or mantle

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,440
material

90
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,440
so they probably involved some kind of

91
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,760
impact at some point in their history

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
but this is all not very well understood

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,640
in any case crucially they are known to

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,720
have

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,920
an extremely slow cooling rate the

96
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
slower skill in the raymond

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
of any rock um so that's less than one

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,239
degree per million years

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
so at that slower cooling rate tetradi

100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,879
is present in

101
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
quite large amounts um so because they

102
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,319
have a

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
relatively poorly understood history and

104
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,519
because there's vegetanite present

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,519
we thought we would apply um several

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,000
um experimental techniques to

107
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,840
compare them and see how like which one

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,519
is best for identified single domain

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,000
tetrathenite um so here here are the

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,840
methods that were used so far

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,560
um we use scanning electron microscopy

112
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,239
with eds and ebsd

113
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
as well as some limited chemical

114
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
analysis with the electron microprobe

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
which i will mention briefly but not

116
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
dwell on um and

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,560
here are um some vault magnetic

118
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,760
measurements um

119
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,799
that were done so far

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,439
uh the sample used was estevel it was a

121
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,799
class

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,880
out of so esther villa zabrachia

123
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,079
my sample is one class of the

124
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,079
spreadsheet on

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
a loan from the oxford museum of natural

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,360
history

127
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,680
and i've separated well i've cut off

128
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,759
three chips of this main mass

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,280
which the measurements are done on um

130
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,120
very briefly um a tour on

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,120
the petrology of this so as i mentioned

132
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,639
it's almost equal parts metal

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
so that's represented by camera sight

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,919
hair with some internal

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,600
variation which i'm going to talk about

136
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,320
in a minute and

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
silicon so this is a metamorphosed

138
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,720
vessels assemblage with

139
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,080
plagioclase and pyroxenes with some

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,680
accessory minerals

141
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
and then there's also sulfide and some

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,520
phosphate

143
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,520
well no one phosphate um

144
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
two identified identified tetrathena

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,720
what we are looking for first

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
is just high nickel metal so this is

147
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
present

148
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,199
first and foremost within the camera

149
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
side which is lower nickel so

150
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,520
as part of for example the cloudy zone

151
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,160
now meteorologists are so slowly cool

152
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,479
that the cloud design actually grew

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
um the the the tetrahedral islands in

154
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,759
the clouds and actually grew too large

155
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
so they are in multi-domain state

156
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,520
um which is why they were not the focus

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,560
of the study we actually looked at the

158
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120
silicates

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
because um multi-domain digital dna is

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
um

161
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,720
is not particularly helpful so focusing

162
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,639
on the silicate instead

163
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,639
um it turns out that metal grains within

164
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,759
the silicon matrix are actually

165
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,039
fairly common so they um come together

166
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,240
with either sulfide

167
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,800
um which is trolite or camosite um

168
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
and they are quite abundant and they

169
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,759
don't seem to have very much

170
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,919
microstructure

171
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
um all of these were identified with

172
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,720
both um

173
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,600
eds and electron probe as high nickel so

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,120
about 54 percent nickel generally

175
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
but this is not actually enough to

176
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,639
identify the tethering eye because

177
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
there's compositional overlap between

178
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,280
um detroit and tennis so then we've

179
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,160
applied

180
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
ebsd to get structural information on

181
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,120
the crystal

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,360
and they were all identified

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,880
successfully as digital

184
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,600
which was great um this is a tiny

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,160
absd map for timing constraints of one

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,360
of these grains

187
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,120
but then of course these grains are a

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,479
few tens of microns across generally

189
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,680
they are still not

190
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,520
um small enough so i've gone

191
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,199
even smaller so um it turns out

192
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,440
there are some nanometric inclusion

193
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,280
inclusions of sulfide and

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,960
metal in some silica crystals

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,039
so here is um a mineral intergroup

196
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,440
between chromite and tridomide in an

197
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
encephalitis host this is all this is

198
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
really interesting

199
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,120
but i don't have time to talk about it

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
uh what i'm going to talk about is these

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,199
inclusion trails here

202
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
majority of these are sulfide but some

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,160
of them are metal

204
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
and some of them are small enough and

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,680
highlightable enough to be

206
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,520
um uh

207
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
to be to have the potential to beat the

208
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,360
training there we go

209
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,360
i don't know if you can see it um there

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
there's a very very tiny about 70

211
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,599
nanometers that's your 29 grain

212
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
well um high nickel grain so then i've

213
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,360
gone and i've tried to

214
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
uh do bsd on this and i've run into a

215
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,599
lot of resolution issues

216
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,280
um it is the at least the way i did that

217
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,800
didn't really cope with that

218
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,039
like that that level of small sizes so

219
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,560
that wasn't great because i couldn't

220
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,680
establish that this was

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,160
detroit night now given that it was

222
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,360
present in the rest of the sample then

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,840
it's a fair assumption that well

224
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,759
i hope it's a fair assumption that the

225
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,039
whole sample did not get reheated above

226
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,199
the ordering temperature

227
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,960
for long enough for that today night to

228
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,400
go back to the night

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,840
um but still it couldn't be established

230
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,440
[Music]

231
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
confidently one final thing i would say

232
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,960
on this

233
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,720
if we zoom out it turns out these

234
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,479
um inclusions are actually quite common

235
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,599
so they continue around here and this

236
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,680
crystal is actually

237
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
about twice the size that is shown here

238
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
and there is another one of it in the

239
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,680
sample

240
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,360
so this so these are quite common these

241
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
um nanometric

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,120
inclusions so i thought barring the fact

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,279
that i couldn't

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,039
um identify statute and i they would

245
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,440
still be quite interesting for some kind

246
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,279
of

247
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,360
localized magnetic study um i started

248
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,640
the magnetic part of the study with

249
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,440
um just bulk measurements

250
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,519
and i got this now i do apologize if my

251
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,959
xylites trigger some kind of

252
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,320
fight or flight response um i'm told

253
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
well i hope that these are quite common

254
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,680
in

255
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,200
meteoric studies um what we see here

256
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,760
in both samples um is a low cost of the

257
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,760
component which demonizes by 12 to 15

258
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,560
milli tesla and there is no

259
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,080
stable high quality component on top of

260
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,320
this

261
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,399
the low cost of the component actually

262
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,000
contains most of the nrm

263
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,519
so essentially the high quality spectrum

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
just doesn't really have any helpful

265
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,750
information

266
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,839
so i've gone and i've

267
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,200
[Music]

268
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,240
done some irm acquisition experiments to

269
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,839
find out what is present in the sample

270
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
according to magnetism as opposed to

271
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,560
microscopy

272
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
and the first one is not particularly

273
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
interesting so here we have

274
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,760
the iron acquisition curve and the

275
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
differential

276
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,839
and we just see uh what is

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,480
representative for multi-domain camosite

278
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,240
with a

279
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,920
peak there at low fields

280
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,880
but if we go to

281
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,279
the next sample some extra picks show up

282
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,600
in

283
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,640
in here in the collectivity spectrum and

284
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,279
there is again the peak for um

285
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
molten main hemocyte now another peak

286
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,839
has appeared for multiple domain

287
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,839
digester night

288
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
which has been identified as such before

289
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,560
in a few papers

290
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,160
there is also a tiny pig here 500 milli

291
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,959
tesla which i'm not entirely sure how to

292
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,240
identify

293
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,120
but it is based on just the one um data

294
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,040
point

295
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
so i would actually like to go and do

296
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,120
this experiment again and get more

297
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,880
um get high resolution in the higher

298
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,800
fields

299
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,640
to see exactly what this is and if if

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,160
the peak stays there

301
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,240
in any case um there is

302
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,279
no or very limited tetragona here

303
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,720
because for

304
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,399
reference here's what um the curve would

305
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,240
look like if there was single domain

306
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,360
tetrathena presence so it starts

307
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,680
jumping up at 600 millivessler mine if

308
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,120
anything saturates the 600

309
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,680
so um conclusion here is that

310
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,519
we have little or no single dimensional

311
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,200
present

312
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,519
um which is a bit strange because

313
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
well it was unclear from the nanometric

314
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,720
um

315
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,839
inclusions that those high nickel grains

316
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,480
were technical but it was likely

317
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
from magnetism i found that there is no

318
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
well

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,279
very little single the main

320
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,959
tetrathermite so

321
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,720
um essentially the only reasonable

322
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,240
conclusion here is um

323
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
in magnets with dress when it comes to

324
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,560
pleasure fahrenheit

325
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,120
um and very briefly i want to talk about

326
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,279
implications for the parent body

327
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
um there is no stable high quality

328
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,920
signal

329
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
this means either there was nothing to

330
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,160
record so that could be because the

331
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
mystery

332
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,120
and the parent body never had the monkey

333
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
field perhaps it didn't differentiate

334
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,560
completely

335
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,720
or perhaps the magnetic field shut off

336
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,639
too early so either because of cooling

337
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,600
and the shot of the dynamo or perhaps

338
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,040
because of a

339
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,800
impact as i mentioned before and impact

340
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,560
has been hypothesized

341
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,440
to be part of the mises reformation

342
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
history

343
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
so perhaps a destructive impact shot of

344
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,639
the dynamo

345
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,560
it is also possible that the field was

346
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,000
in fact too low intensity

347
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,480
um to be recorded so if the fidelity

348
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,920
if the sample fidelity of vestable is

349
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
not high enough

350
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,360
so because of their steamy your next

351
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,440
step is to go and do some air and

352
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
fidelity experiments

353
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,120
i was going to do this in march and then

354
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
there was a pandemic

355
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,079
so this is this is happening as soon as

356
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,079
i can get back into a lab

357
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,880
and in longer term i would like to get

358
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,639
high resolution ubsd maps of

359
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,920
metals and higher resolution

360
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,680
well look at the microstructure as well

361
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,440
higher resolution are in my position as

362
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,639
i mentioned before and

363
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,720
i am curious about applying in-situ

364
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,399
magnetic techniques to those inclusions

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,800
but at the same time i am aware that

366
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,639
misused rights are just

367
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,560
not very good for magnetic studies it

368
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,800
turns out so

369
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
maybe this is a little bit of a dead end

370
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
but i'm very interested in hearing

371
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
opinions

372
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,839
thank you

373
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:23,440
thank you so do you have any questions

374
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,519
yeah let's talk um i was gonna ask about

375
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,120
your your ebsd

376
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,279
so you were able to identify tetratenite

377
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,639
in your ebsd

378
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,839
was that based on uh you had enough

379
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,160
resolution to detect

380
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,680
the tetragonal distortion of the

381
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,440
tetratenite or were you able to pick up

382
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,240
the the the extra diffraction peaks that

383
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,320
you get because of the ironical ordering

384
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
um so it identified the tetragonal

385
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,920
structure of the jotani

386
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,760
all of these grains in the matrix were

387
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,440
remarkably homogeneous

388
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
there wasn't really anything going on in

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,279
them um but no it didn't really identify

390
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
peaks about

391
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,160
um on distortion or anything like that

392
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
but that'll be really interesting the

393
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,440
distortion's enough

394
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,000
you can confidently distinguish the

395
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
cubic from the tetragonal

396
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,560
yeah uh this was based on the um on a

397
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,920
tetrahedron reference file from the uh

398
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,800
american okay

399
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,800
that's good yeah

400
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,880
it may be nice to try that on the we we

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
did try

402
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,199
wanted to try that on the cloudy zone in

403
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,839
the mesa ciderise to see if you could

404
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,320
identify the differently oriented

405
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
uh variants within the cloudies i think

406
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,199
that would be

407
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,880
that would be very interesting it's

408
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,320
looking like you're getting very nice

409
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:46,160
data uh so that would be an interesting

410
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,639
yeah i was um tentatively pointing the

411
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
uh pointing the gun at the cloudy zone

412
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,800
um

413
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,880
with um with ebsd but i was actually

414
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,240
getting really really messy

415
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,160
patterns i'm guessing either the the

416
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
the length scale of the microstructures

417
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,560
were smaller than the resolution

418
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,519
that absd had about that particular

419
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,240
moment but yeah i think that'll be

420
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,720
interesting

421
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:14,639
yeah it's not easy no imagine this

422
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,880
thank you yeah any more questions

423
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
uh i'll just ask a quick question just

424
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,839
uh on the

425
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,519
in-situ magnetic techniques that you

426
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,519
plan to use um

427
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,800
so what specifically are you thinking

428
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
and you know do you think you can you

429
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
can get to the resolution that you need

430
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,680
um so i was tentatively thinking about

431
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,240
squid microscopy or maybe

432
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,800
um quantum down on microscopy this was

433
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
also to

434
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
put on hold by covert because we

435
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,800
realized we need to go abroad to do

436
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,800
these things

437
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,240
um so i have not thought about them in

438
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,240
detail but i think the resolution is

439
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,240
possible
